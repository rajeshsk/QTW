    "OK, so this week, we received a request from our IT department in that we as a company receive a significant amount of spam. So we've been given a collection of emails, both normal and spam, and ***our goal is that we need to process this data and then build a classifier that will classify emails as spam or not spam ***\n",

    "***So our goal for this week is to build a model that can take any given email and provide a classification.*** So essentially, what we're doing is we're building an email filter. And your task is to go through all of this data, process it, and then build, based on the contents of an email, a model that can predict whether any given email is spam or not spam.\n"

      "    Making a mesh on the move  A new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G  reports Peter Rojas  Peter Rojas Thursday August 29  2002 The Guardian  Imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from anywhere  at any time   you could watch a live video webcast while waiting for the bus  email photos to your friends while sitting in the park  or download the MP3 of the song that s playing in the pub before it finishes   This is the vision of a high speed wireless internet paradise that the third generation  3G  mobile phone companies have been promoting for years  3G services are just beginning to be rolled out  but a new technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever dream   Two companies  US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany  are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking  Instead of the current hub and spoke model of wireless communications  with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna  any time  mesh enabled  devices   mobile phones  PDAs  laptops   are in close proximity to each other  they automatically create a wireless mesh network  Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router  relaying traffic for everyone else  Traffic hops from person to person until it reaches the nearest internet access point  reducing the need for central antennas  and improving wireless coverage   As the number of mobile phones soars  and wireless PDAs  laptops  and other devices begin to crowd the spectrum  this approach to wireless networking may be inevitable   Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless networks  While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users connection speeds of up to 144 kbps  roughly three times faster than a dial up modem   Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection speeds of up to 6Mbps  over a hundred times faster than dial up  The technologies they use include Wi Fi   the emerging standard for high speed wireless networking also known as 802 11b  A similarly short range protocol called UltraWideBand  which is poised to succeed Wi Fi  is even faster and could  by 2005  approach 400 Mbps   The range of a typical Wi Fi network is generally too limited to be of much use when travelling around a city  Mesh networks get around the problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic  Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small  because  in theory  there will be so many users in the surrounding area  connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless connection   Because mesh networks use Wi Fi  the equipment and infrastructure needed to create them is cheap and readily available  Instead of building cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds  all that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points  around  100 now  placed strategically around town to relay traffic  and the proper software  Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh enabled by software   It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network  Unlike with 3G cellular  the part of the spectrum that Wi Fi operates on is unregulated in the US  Britain  The mobile phone companies are none too pleased about this  especially since many of them spent billions of pounds acquiring 3G licences   All that s needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect to the network  With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets better  instead of getting worse  as is the case with mobile phone networks   But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have high speed internet connections everywhere  and everyone s laptops  PDAs  and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds  sharing music  movies  or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy  When UltraWideBand hits  all of this will just accelerate   At 400Mbps  copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds  Sooner or later  playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of their favourite songs  movies  and video games   But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers  MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high speed wireless service  Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others  such as cities that want to provide wireless internet to police  fire  and public works employees  or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the cheap  Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for enterprise networks   The first place average users may use the technology is when it is incorporated into vehicles  enabling motorists to access the internet at high speeds  which both companies see happening soon   When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in your pocket  It s too soon to say  but just as broadband internet service was initially available only to businesses and universities  eventually someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses     \n",

      "   Evangelicals  threat to new archbishop  Direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality  Stephen Bates  religious affairs correspondent Tuesday October 8  2002 The Guardian  Evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust Rowan Williams  the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury  before he even takes up his post  by threatening to take  direct action  against him  The council of the Church Society  the Church of England s oldest evangelical body  joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform  which is also opposed to Dr Williams  in calling on him to recant his supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down  Following an emergency meeting  the 167 year old society  whose leaders met the archbishop last week  proclaimed their continued opposition to his appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him  The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to destabilise the new archbishop  whose leftwing political views are regarded with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement  Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams s acknowledgement that he has ordained a gay priest  something many bishops have done  and that those who have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned  The new archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the church  Nevertheless  the society said   It is clear that he prefers his private judgment to the voice of scripture  to the voice of tradition and to the common mind of the church  As such he can only be a focus of disunity   The council    called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan Williams would see the error in his teaching  change his views or stand down   it said  The society claimed to have drawn up an  action plan   including calling on bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion  of which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders  to distance themselves from Dr Williams s doctrinal and ethical position  It promised it would be  taking steps towards appropriate direct action   It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal called Theology and Sexuality which  six months ago  published articles allegedly commending homosexual behaviour  Despite its claim  the society does not represent the common mind of the church  Dr Williams  currently Archbishop of Wales  was chosen by the crown appointments commission of church members  including evangelicals  and his appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen  He is due to succeed George Carey  who retires this month  and will be formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February  Asked what form direct action might take  the Rev George Curry  the society s chairman  said   Watch this space   Presumably it could involve a small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams is present  Church of England bishops  who have hitherto largely kept their heads down during the row  are meeting next week to discuss their response to the evangelical extremists  challenge  which appears to have grown in the absence of a robust rebuttal  A letter by senior theologians in today s Guardian  however  repudiates the evangelicals  tactics  calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical teaching  On the BBC s Thought for the Day yesterday  Angela Tilby  vice principal of Westcott House  Cambridge  accused Dr Williams s opponents of presumption and blackmail   It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave  It is attempting to force an issue by emotional violence    manipulating to get your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation   she said  Last week  Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened   Matters of sexuality should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church Society have tried to give them  The archbishop cannot withdraw his appointment since so many  including evangelicals  have urged him to take the post    the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God                              Yahoo  Groups Sponsor                           Sell a Home with Ease                                                                             To unsubscribe from this group  send an email to  forteana unsubscribe egroups com    Your use of Yahoo  Groups is subject to    \n",

      " URL   Date  Not supplied  I received some feedback in email  from several of you actually  regarding my earlier blog about the Parents Television Council  which recently published a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for children  Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much   Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12  and a game like GTA3 is as well  The PTC  however  has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games  There is a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8 9pm  the first hour of primetime  must be designated a family hour  and that no offensive shows should air during that time  I don t believe that it s the networks  responsibility to restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television  The shows that air during primetime run the gamut  some are family oriented and some aren t  There is  however  no shortage of suitable content should parents and children wish to watch TV together during this hour   It should be the parent s responsibility to police a child s television viewing  If you don t want your kids watching  Buffy the Vampire Slayer   then don t let them  but don t campaign to have the show removed from the air or shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because you don t like its content  If you don t think a show is appropriate  don t let your kids watch it   The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family oriented  An example of one such show is  Malcolm in the Middle   I would hardly call this show inappropriate for kids  Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their ultra conservative agenda  Even then  I wouldn t really mind  but the idea that all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous      \n",

      "  I wanted to get back to this but didn t have the time   I actually lived on a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota Sioux country as well   And my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than I have  my experience being a direct result of living with my parents    I do get a lot of my information first hand  or in some cases  second hand from my father   The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading  mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income   While it is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty  it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe  not something that was impressed upon them   The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals  typically an  Indian Corporation  of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share  the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe    In most tribes  a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation  usually to the tune of  10 30k per person  depending on the tribe   The dividend money comes from a number of places  with the primary sources being the Federal Gov t and various businesses assets owned by the Indian corporation   You have to understand a couple things   First  a great many Indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises   Everyone gets a check for their share no matter what   One of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment  often 70 90   for tribal members  who are more than happy take their dividend and not work   The dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole  income  for government accounting purposes   Unfortunately  to support this type of economics when no one works  they ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends   Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works   One of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn  many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk  not Indians   Second  even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend  they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually   By benefits and perks  we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government   It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are ineptly run  and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians  a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non Indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions   An example of this is the Haida Corporation  which while having less 1 000 tribal shareholders  has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the  200 300 million range  and growing    Yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled  about  20k in this particular case  and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use   They don t eat their seed corn  and have actually managed to grow their stash   In contrast  a couple islands over  there is another tribe of  2 000 people that has a net loss of about  50 million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets   This particular tribe has a modest income in theory  but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars  and many borrow money against future income   Incidentally  in this particular case  the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year  much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets   Somewhat annoying  the Federal government semi regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they ve burned through the ones previously given where feasible  typically selling the assets to American or foreign companies   And the cycle continues   So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems   In a nutshell  a thoroughly pathological culture and society   Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant   Incest  rape  and gross promiscuity is rampant   Inbreeding  heavy drug abuse during pregnancy  and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded   Many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity  mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above   On one reservation my parents lived  the HIV infection rate was  70    Many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt  and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious  they do have their own judges  courts  police etc    In short  many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I have ever seen anywhere   Because of their legal status  there really aren t that many consequences for their behavior   There are many things that I could tell you that I ve seen that you probably would not believe unless you d seen it yourself   There are always good people in these tribes  but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times  and this IS a mobocracy typically    BTW  if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs  try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations   It will give you an interesting perspective on things    There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous Indians   The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely   The second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part  even if they maintain their tribal identity   In both of these cases  the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above   The Indians are often quite wealthy technically  and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita   And the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole   It is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income   The poverty is social and cultural in nature  not economic   This was my original point    On a tangent   One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi tribal corporate socialism   Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mind bogglingly bad in execution   That they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything   But what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run   It is like a Family Corporation writ large   It seems that in a future where  familial  ties will be increasingly voluntary  the general concept may have some merit in general Western society  serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics  but with an arbitrary set of self selecting individuals   Damn that was long  and its late   and it could have been a lot longer    James Rogers jamesr best com    On 9 22 02 3 53

                Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand Thu Aug 29 10 19 AM ET By Andrew Marshall  BANGKOK  Thailand  Reuters    English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand looking for a wife  It took two hours to find her    The first day I went out with Wan  she came back to my hotel and hung all my clothes up and tidied the room  I thought it was marvelous   he said   I knew then there was something special    Moylan  49  is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet    and marry    Thai women  He lives in England now with 28 year old Wan  who is expecting their first child   Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women in developing countries  offering dreams of a new life in the West that often turn sour  But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand in search of a wife    I got to Thailand at 2 p m   and by 4 p m  I d met Wan   he said   I knew I found her attractive  I could tell straight away that she was very caring    Moylan spent a week in Thailand  and after returning to England kept in touch with Wan by phone and mail  Six months later she came to England and the couple married   MR  MARRIAGE  Lawrence Lynch  49  runs Thai Professional Introduction Services  the agency Moylan used to meet his wife  Lynch  who calls himself  Mr  Marriage   started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction agency   Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages    In the last five years we ve done about 400   he said   To the best of my knowledge  they have all been successful    Male clients pay  2 213 for the service  although men from countries that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount  Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women looking for a husband  If they like what they see they come to Bangkok   Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch s office    encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems    We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies   Lynch said   But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax    After the first meeting  couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better  Within two weeks of arrival  Lynch says  almost every client has found a potential wife    At the end of a fortnight it s very  very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasn t made his mind up   he said  In most cases  marriage follows  usually within the next year   Roongthip Kamchat  managing director of Thai No  1 Connections  a Bangkok based agency  says she has introduced about 1 000 couples  and less than 10 percent have broken up   Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife    Sometimes they are very nervous   she said   And sometimes they are very impatient and say  Give me a lady  I want to get married now   I say   Calm down  OK  we ll talk     But if men are really in a hurry  Roongthip says  she can find them a wife and get them married within a week  Lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man  a man with one leg and a man with post traumatic stress disorder   WHY   Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries  Critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country  and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West   But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy  there is no reason to object   If you talk about people who are needy  I think everybody wants someone to love them  and wants someone to love  so yes  I need Wan   he said    Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand  I think there s no secret there  They are looking for a better life  I don t have a problem with that  In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband    Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too  and that is why they choose to use his agency   His brochure promises an alternative to the  kind of de feminized  over sized  self centered  mercenary minded lady available on the British singles scene   and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are not  God s gift to women    Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their own countries    and found Thai women attractive    They don t know how to meet women  Even if they go to pubs or discotheques or restaurants or department stores  how can they ask people to marry them  Impossible   she said    Many Thai girls are slim  have long hair  black eyes  small nose  They are good at taking care and joking and laughing  not strict  Different from ladies from other countries    Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap  the agencies say this is not a problem  They say language problems are also not a major obstacle    Thai ladies are not ageist  and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older   Lynch said   When I met my wife she couldn t speak a word of English  We muddled along with a phonetic dictionary  The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up very quickly    Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the West    We have kitchens  we have study classes   Roongthip said   We teach them how to eat  and when to make tea    PITFALLS  But not all dreams come true   Bee  is a 26 year old Thai woman who went to Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency  Now she is back in Bangkok  sad and angry    He had no friends  and I was so lonely   she said   I tried to make him happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean  He never spoke to me    Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year   I thought I would be happy there   she said   But it was the worst time of my life    Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run  he makes checks to ensure unsuitable candidates are weeded out    We are ethical and professional   he said   We will not take on all comers    Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls  his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work  Wan s sister has just signed up with Lynch s company  looking for a foreign husband    Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited  I m sure there are   Moylan said   But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal

      "   Pro hunt activists target top sight  ONE of Yorkshire s most famous sights yesterday became one of the first targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting debate  Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the night  In another incident  the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman and three hounds added to the ancient figure  which is thought to represent a Celtic god or tribal symbol  Pro hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance  RCA    a radical alternative to the better known Countryside Alliance   admitted responsibility last night for targeting the two images  The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in 1857  But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman with a horn   which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white carpet  It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse Association  who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet  John Roberts of the association said   It has obviously been very well organised  It was a well crafted piece of kit  a figure of a huntsman with a horn cut out of carpets   It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about  They tied it to bushes at the top and nailed it down  It caused all the stone chippings to be pushed downwards  which will help turn the white horse grey  It will not get another refit for another year   Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle   a tractor and trailer or a lorry   because the carpet must have come in one piece  It was extremely well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off   The sculpture needs constant work because  unlike chalk horses in the south of England  it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs whitening  Mr Roberts added   The damage as such is not great but it adds to the deterioration  which means it will need more work next time   We would have more sympathy if  having made the point  they would come to take it away again because it was a major job   Andy Wilson  chief executive of the North York Moors National Park  said   It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white  There is also careful consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes  There has not been a cut in the turf   which would be much more of a problem  It would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand   An RCA spokesman said   Some people in the country are getting very frustrated at the inaction  All we want is Ministers to take notice  Marches don t seem to be doing anything good   The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action  Spokesman Adrian Yelland said   The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident   The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in Yorkshire thought to be RCA work                            Yahoo  Groups Sponsor                           4 DVDs Free  s p Join Now                                                                            To unsubscribe from this group  send an email to  forteana unsubscribe egroups com    Your use of Yahoo  Groups is subject to    \n",

      " Hindus mourn  monkey god    By Omer Farooq BBC reporter in Hyderabad  Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh    The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed  Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over zealous worshippers   The animal was cremated in Anantapur district  400 kilometres  250 miles  south of the state capital  Hyderabad  on Sunday   It had not eaten for three weeks   Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god  Hanuman   Garlanded  One animal rights activist said his group s efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people    The monkey s death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple  but were prevented by villagers   The monkey  which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month ago  attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages  as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka   Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock    Exploited   Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village  as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents   But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated   They filed a petition in the state s High Court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple   The group also alleged that people s religious feelings were being exploited to make money   The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey   but villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time     \n",
      " I think that when considering deployment  a solution that supports all Python platforms and not just the L Unix crowd is desirable   Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that s unlikely to offer hooking ability  at least not easily   As mentioned elsewhere  even L Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to their MTA   SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals       My notion of a solution for Windows Outlook has been  as Guido described  a client server  Client side does pop3 imap mapi fetching  of which  I m only going to implement pop3 initially  potentially on several hosts  spamhams the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message  qmail style    The MUA accesses this  eThunk  as a server to obtain all the ham  Spam is retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection  and training of spam filter  and the ham will go forward  after being used for training  on the next MUA fetch  eThunk would sit on a timer for  always online  users  but I am not clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme   Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA  Hopefully all MUAs can split the host fetch send URL s  IMO  end users are likely to be more intested in n way classification  If this is available  the  simple viewer  could be enhanced to support viewing via folders and  at least for me  the Outlook nightmare is over   I would use this as my only MUA   N B  according to my recent readings  the best n way classifier uses something called a  Support Vector Machine   SVM  which is 5 8  more accurate then Naive Bayes  NB      I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code  That way  it could be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user s situation   David LeBlanc Seattle  WA USA  \n",

having the kernel compiled by me  I have no kernel source package installed   I ve added a flag  kernsrc   that also can be used   without  to remove the dependency for kernel source at build time   It would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist   lib modules `uname  r` build include linux   h   though  however  I m a beginner in RPM building    is it possible to BuildRequire for a file not provided by a package at all   I ve googled a bit  and found no way to do that   I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the   with cards option in alsa s

the first version of alsa driver for 2 4 18 10  although I don t have that kernel  to supply the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm s  and compiled the modules from source   It created the  dev

      "    I think one step towards deployment is creating a re usable tokenizer   for mail messages   The current codebase doesn t expose an easy to use   or easy to customize tokenizer   tokenize   couldn t be easier to use   it takes a string argument  and produces a stream of tokens  whether via explicit list  or generator  or tuple  or     doesn t matter    All the tokenize   functions in GBayes py and timtest py are freely interchangeable this way   Note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would do any good  or  if it would  in which ways customization could be helpful  That s a research issue on which no work has been done     The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical   knowledge about how to parse mail messages  but the module wasn t   designed for re use   That s partly a failure of imagination  wink    Splitting out all knowledge of tokenization is just a large block cut and paste     there  it s done  Change the  from timtoken import tokenize  at the top to use any other tokenizer now   If you want to make it easier still  feel free to check in something better     I d like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of   messages and tokenize each one   The Msg and MsgStream classes in timtest py are a start at that  but it s hard to do anything truly  useful  here when people use all sorts of different physical representations for email msgs  mboxes in various formats  one file per  folder   one file per msg  Skip s gzipped gimmick         If you re a Python coder  wink   you  should  find it very easy to change the guts of Msg and MsgStream to handle your peculiar scheme  Defining interfaces for these guys should be done     I d like to see the tokenize by customizable  too   Tim had to exclude   some headers from his test data  because there were particular biases   in the test data   If other people have test data without those   biases  they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include   them or exclude others   This sounds like a bottomless pit to me  and there s no easier way to customize than to edit the code   As README txt still says  though  massive refactoring would help   Hop to it  \n",

      " URL   Date  Not supplied  Feedback from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four categories     Why make Setup reversable  Instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end    There are a couple of things to understand here  First of all  even if you do everything in one batch at the end  there s always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail  and in that case  a well behaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done  There are well over 100 error messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant   Second  it s not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake  For example  early in the FogBUGZ setup process we prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use     The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons  none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account  For example  the password might not conform to the system password policy  And different national versions of Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords  betcha didn t know that    It s better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later  forcing the user to back up and fix it  And even if you force the user to back up and fix it  you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account  otherwise you ve left their system in an indeterminate state   In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails  I might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where I can display a useful error message   And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable  Well  in order to upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot  and we  never  ever  require a reboot   we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down  such as IIS  Microsoft s web server   So part one of the batch is  Stop IIS   Now if part 2 fails for some reason  it would be  extremely  rude to leave IIS not running  And anyway  it s not like I don t need to write the code for  Start IIS  for the end of the batch  So the code to rollback  Stop IIS  is already written  No big deal  I just need to call it at the right place   I think one reason that people think you should  gather all the info and then do all the work  is because with very large installation programs that are very slow  this is a polite way to waste less of the user s time  Indeed even FogBUGZ setup does 95  of its work at the very end  But the  create account  operation is so fast  that principle simply doesn t apply here  Even our 95  of the work phase takes well under a minute  most of which is spent waiting for IIS to stop and start     Why did you use VC   MFC  Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself has admitted by now that Delphi is more productive    First of all  leave your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door  Somehow I managed to figure out  in high school  that language advocacy and religious arguments are unbelievably boring   Secondly  even if Delphi were more productive  the only pertinent question  since I am writing the code  is  what is more productive for Joel Spolsky   And I don t know Delphi at all  but I know Win32  MFC  and VC    really  really well   So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer  I would definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer  which is me   certainly over a short 4 week project  Third  many of the things I needed to do in this setup program are things like  grant the Logon as Service privilege to an account   This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general  When you search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT  what you find is about 75  C code  maybe 20  VB code  and 5  everything else  Yes  I know  I could translate the C code into Delphi  assuming I was a sophisticated Delphi programmer  not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer   but that costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more productive programming language  And fourth  I already had about 30  of the code I needed for Setup in MFC format  from FogBUGZ 2 0 Setup  and a library I ve been using for years to make wizards     Why make Setup at all  You already have your customers  money  Good Setup programs don t increase sales    This was actually the smartest question and made me think the hardest  I came up with three reasons     Decreased tech support cost  This setup program will pay for itself over the life of the code    Delight my customers  When I m trying to get them to upgrade to 4 0  I want them to remember how painless the 3 0 installation was  so they won t hesitate because they are afraid to upgrade  I m still using an old version of SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective  even though I know the new version is much better  because I just can t bear the thought of another morning wasted  The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation    all the little SSH windows  some su ed  trying to scroll through man pages and Google Groups  accidentally hitting Ctrl Z in Emacs to undo and having it suspend  trying to guess why we can t get the MTA to run procmail  sorry it s too much  If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have lost my business because they don t have a SETUP program    Win reviews  Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of standardized way to rate software  even when they are comparing apples and oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers  They always have a meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games  mainframe databases  web site auction software  and DNA sequencing software  And Setup is always on their list  A single flaw in setup is guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it and say  Aha       How can we make WISE better    Kudos to the product manager of WISE Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the reasons his product wasn t adequate for typical IIS ASP SQL applications            \n",

      "               Additional Comments From spamassassin contrib msquadrat de  2002 10 03 13 57           I ve thought about this and PM FILTER needs to die  I ve now tried   multiple ways to make it just transparently work on 5 00503 and failed    If anyone has any bright ideas please jump in      You see anyone upgrading from the CPAN shell will get a failure on the line         use ExtUtils  MakeMaker 5 45   Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays  I think or read so somewhere  respectively   And the Perl error message is very clear   ExtUtils  MakeMaker version 5 45 required  this is only version 5 4302 at Makefile PL line 2      Because it never gets chance to reach a  WriteMakefile  line with a   PREREQ PM      ExtUtils  MakeMaker    5 45   option  So the CPAN shell   can t automatically upgrade this module  I cannot think of any way   around this   I could think of a solution  We could remove the  use  line and add the version to PREREQ PM  After WriteMakefile   we could add the lines require ExtUtils  MakeMaker  ExtUtils  MakeMaker  VERSION 5 45   to do per hand what  use ExtUtils  MakeMaker 5 45  does automagically  `perl Makefile PL` will die with a  Uncaught exception from user code  ExtUtils  MakeMaker version 5 45 required  this is only version 5 4302 at Makefile PL line 103   there but we ve got a Makefile  But I don t know if CPAN will run the make anyway       To add insult to injury  the PM FILTER part gets run during pm to blib    which would be fine  except ExtUtils  MakeMaker doesn t let you write a   MY  pm to blib   it s non overridable  So even though we could   potentially copy the 5 45 ExtUtils  Install  pm to blib code somewhere   into the spamassassin codebase  I tried that first   we can t cause the   Makefile to call our code      We could call the preprocessor on install time  That s not a very clean approach but could work   We can also overwrite pm to blib in the Makefile directly per postamble  We already have a useless line  pm to blib  spamassassin doc  made  there  Adding some commands in this section gives some make warnings   Makefile 933  warning  overriding commands for target `pm to blib  Makefile 877  warning  ignoring old commands for target `pm to blib    but does work  Not a very good solution either     So I m  strongly  against the current use of ExtUtils  MakeMaker 5 45   usage  if this were an Apache project this would be my veto vote   and   really hope we can find another way   The  use MakeMaker       error message is IMHO quite clear  so I think it s ok to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils  MakeMaker before the SA installation  But that s just my opinion      I ll ask on makemaker perl org for the best solution  They should know             You are receiving this mail because          You are on the CC list for the bug  or are watching someone who is                                                            This sf net email is sponsored by ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven                                                   Spamassassin devel mailing list Spamassassin devel lists sourceforge net   \n",

      " I attended the same conference  and was impressed by a few systems that Jim didn t mention  In terms of CMS  the following all had apparently been used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some pretty strong competition to commercial systems    Midgard     a PHP based content management framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS   Redhat CCM CMS  Java based     OpenCMS  Java based    There was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source strength  but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movement towards improving that situation   I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML  Some took for granted that XSLT was relevant to content management  others took it just as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore XML almost completely   I attended realizing that  content management  is generally used to apply to  Web  content management  but I was still a bit shocked how completely out of scope document management was  almost no consideration of the potential print PDF dimension to content other than the occasional     and you can use FOP to make PDF  as if that was functional   this seems more the case in open source content management than in commercial content management  and probably makes XML easier to ignore  if HTML is the be all and end all of the output       The honesty was refreshing  Phil Suh complained about the state of current tools  both open source and commercial   and I wish I d written down what he said  something like  it sucks so extremely  it sucks so widely  and it is so generally sucking  that it seems sometimes there is no hope   For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial systems scaled so well that the commercial  big boys  were really much more functional than open source  until someone pointed out   OK  take some average blog software  spend  500 000 on the rollout    it ll scale pretty well   Another quote  citing Brendan Quinn    content management problems are either trivial or impossible    Mac OS X is getting popular  of the laptops there it was an even 1 3 each of Mac  Linux  Windows   I am sure it wasn t news to Jim  but I can t wait to try Subversion  a CVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV    I m also eager to try Xopus  I hope the developers make it back home safely  they said they d only been in America four days but were already homeless     Max   \n",

      "        TP     Tim Peters  tim one comcast net  writes      The false positive rate is 0 3     Finally   I had to scrub a    bunch of previously unnoticed spam from my inbox    Both    collections have about 1100 messages   TP  Does this mean you trained on about 1100 of each   The total collections are 1100 messages   I trained with 1100 5 messages   TP  Can t guess   You re in a good position to start adding more TP  headers into the analysis  though   For example  an easy start TP  would be to uncomment the header counting lines in tokenize   TP   look for  Anthony     Likely the most valuable thing it s TP  missing then is some special parsing and tagging of Received TP  headers   I tried the  Anthony  stuff  but it didn t make any appreciable difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate  The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices   Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the words in the header and emitted like this   s   s     hdr  word   That worked too well       The received and date headers helped the classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is new   So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received  data  and x from   which all contained timestamps   I also skipped the X VM  headers that my mail reader added   class MyTokenizer Tokenizer    skip     received   1   date   1   x from    1     def tokenize headers self  msg   for k  v in msg items    k   k lower   if k in self skip or k startswith  x vm    continue for w in subject word re findall v   for t in tokenize word w   yield   s  s     k  t   This did moderately better   The false negative rate is 7 21  over the tests performed so far   This is versus 11 28  for the previous test run that used the timtest header tokenizer   It s interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham discriminators   There s not a single spam indicator in the list  Most of the discriminators are header fields   One thing to note is that the presence of Mailman generated headers is a strong non spam indicator   That matches my intuition  I got an awful lot of Mailman generated mail  and those lists are pretty good at surpressing spam   The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use XEmacs   That s probably Barry  Guido  Fred  and me       One final note   It looks like many of the false positives are from people I ve never met with questions about Shakespeare   They often start with stuff like     Dear Sir Madam      May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a   solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly  I am old science student  I guess that reads a lot like spam       Jeremy   238 hams   221 spams false positive  2 10084033613 false negative  9 50226244344 new false positives   new false negatives    best discriminators   x mailscanner clean  671 0 0483425  x spam status IN REP TO  679 0 01  delivered to skip s 10  691 0 0829876  x mailer Lucid  699 0 01  x mailer XEmacs  699 0 01  x mailer patch  699 0 01  x mailer under  709 0 01  x mailscanner Found  716 0 0479124  cc zope com  718 0 01  i ll  750 0 01  references skip 1 20  767 0 01  rossum  795 0 01  x spam status skip S 10  825 0 01  van  850 0 01   869 0 01  email addr zope  883 0 01  from python org  895 0 01  to jeremy  902 0 185401  zope  984 0 01  list archive skip m 10  1058 0 01  list subscribe skip m 10  1058 0 01  list unsubscribe skip m 10  1058 0 01  from zope com  1098 0 01  return path zope com  1115 0 01  wrote   1129 0 01  jeremy  1150 0 01  email addr python  1257 0 01  x mailman version 2 0 13  1311 0 01  x mailman version 101270  1395 0 01  python  1401 0 01 \n",

designed   specifically to process XML data  Unlike competing solutions that   process XML data in software  DataPower s device processes   the data in   hardware    a technology achievement that provides greater   performance    according to company officials      The new device  dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator  is the   first in a   family of products expected from the Cambridge  Mass  based   startup  The   DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology   called XG3 that does the analysis  parsing  and processing of the XML   data      According to Steve Kelly  CEO of DataPower  the XA35 Accelerator was   conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML  the anticipated future   proliferation of Web services  and as a means to share data   between two   businesses       Our vision is to build out an XML aware infrastructure   Kelly said     The XA35 is the first of a family       Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the   file size up   to 20 times  This  he said  makes processing the data very taxing on   application servers  DataPower believes an inline device is the best   alternative      In addition to the large file sizes  security is also of paramount   importance in the world of XML       Today s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only   Kelly   said   A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall    Firewalls are blind to XML today       Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on   security  especially as Web services proliferate  Kelly said      According to DataPower  most existing solutions to offload XML   processing are homegrown and done in software    an approach   the company   itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with   regards to speed   and security  After trying the software path  the company turned to   creating a solution that would process XML in hardware       Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code   said Kelly    adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does  Kelly   said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with   technologies that claim to do XML processing    claims that   he believes   will be mostly false    Other content aware switches  such as SSL  secure socket layer    accelerators and load balancers  look at the first 64 bytes   of a packet    while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection  looking at   1 400 bytes   and thus enabling greater processing of XML data  Kelly explained      The 1U high network device has been tested against a large   collection of   XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the   markup language   as they pass through the device      The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load   balancer  and it will inspect all traffic that passes and   will identify   and process those packets that are XML  Kelly said      In addition to proxy mode  the device can also be used as an   application   co processor  This deployment method gives administrators   more granular   control over what data is inspected and the application server itself   controls the device      DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging   market  Startup   Sarvega  based in Burr Ridge  Ill   introduced the Sarvega   XPE switch in   May  and earlier this month Tarari  an Intel spin off    launched with a   focus on content processing and acceleration    The DataPower device is now available  priced starting at    54 995  The   company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in   field trails at a number of other enterprises                                                                                       DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs   since it was   founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov  a technology visionary who   foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols   would have on enterprise networks  Long before industry   interest in XML   grew  Kuznetsov assembled a team of world class M I T  engineers and   designed the industry s first solutions to address the unique   requirements for processing XML  The first such solution was   a software   interpreter called DGXT  This software based approach to XML   processing   is still licensed by many companies for use in their own   products today      Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from   developing software based accelerators  Kuznetsov s team   raised the bar   and designed a system for processing XML in purpose built   hardware  In   2001  DataPower s effort produced XML Generation Three  XG3    the   industry s fastest technology for XML processing  bar none      Today  XG3  technology powers the industry s first wire speed XML   network devices  enabling secure  high speed applications and XML Web   Services  While other companies are just now marketing first   versions of   products  DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology    providing an immediate return on technology investments to   industry leading customers and partners      DataPower s M I T  heritage is complemented by a management team that   brings decades of experience in the networking and computing   industries    drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including

wednesday thorugh saturday    I ve also started contacting hotels for group rates  some of the group rates are no better than the regular rates  and they require signing a contract with a minimum

situated hotels nearby at higher rates  Also  I m not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia only discount   I can t vouch for any of these hotels  either   I also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid june through mid september  and mid november through mid january   Z       This one has no MIME structure nor HTML   It even has a Content disposition which is counted as a non spam clue   It got f p ed because of the many hospitality related and money related terms   I m surprised  125 night and similar aren t clues too    And again  several spam clues are duplicated

    2  These are pure HTML  not multipart alternative with a text plain part        so that the tags aren t getting stripped   The pickled classifier      despises all hints of HTML due to its c l py heritage      3  These are multipart alternative with a text plain part  but the      latter doesn t contain the same text as the text html part  for      example  as Anthony reported  perhaps the text plain part just      says something like  This is an HMTL message         If it s  2  it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize     meaning  even if it is pure HTML  strip the tags anyway    In fact  I d like   to do that and default it to True   The extreme hatred of HTML on tech lists   strikes me as  umm  extreme  wink    I also looked in more detail at some f p s in my geeks traffic   The first one s a doozie  that s the term  right        It has lots of HTML clues that are apparently ignored   It was a multipart mixed with two parts  a brief text plain part containing one or two sentences  a mondo weird URL     and some employer generated spammish boilerplate  the second part was the HTML taken directly from the above URL   Clues   43 1 00 S   main    0

 It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long term   as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term      Many of you may disagree  but I found the document below surprisingly   centrist  If you know the code  you can hear clearly partisan tones  re    ICC  Taiwan Relations Act  etc  But  still  this is as much a Democratic   platform as not  Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared   they might      As you read  replace  United States  with  Roman Empire  and it may make   as much sense  in the long view of history  I don t know how proud to be   about that  but it is telling  Sometime I daydream that the President   might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to   our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700  military installations   overseas and what they do for us  It would be a powerful education on   how engaged we are in the world around us      Heck  I d love to see a real time map of Federal expenditures around the   globe  a softly glowing necklace of embassies  carriers  arctic research   stations  hotels  golf courses  warehouses  libraries  clinics and all   the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy      Of course  this still doesn t leave me any more comfortable with the   real news in this document  the Bush Doctrine for pre emptive strikes    I d sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit   such a principle to be loosed upon the world      Rohit                                                             September 20  2002     Full Text  Bush s National Security Strategy     Following is the full text of President Bush s new national security   strategy  The document  entitled  The National Security Strategy of the   United States   will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of   the Administration s policy      INTRODUCTION     THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and   totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of   freedom    and a single sustainable model for national success  freedom    democracy  and free enterprise  In the twenty first century  only   nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and   guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the   potential of their people and assure their future prosperity  People   everywhere want to say what they think  choose who will govern them    worship as they please  educate their children    male and female  own   property  and enjoy the benefits of their labor  These values of freedom   are right and true for every person  in every society    and the duty of   protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of   freedom loving people across the globe and across the ages      Today  the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military   strength and great economic and political influence  In keeping with our   heritage and principles  we do not use our strength to press for   unilateral advantage  We seek instead to create a balance of power that   favors human freedom  conditions in which all nations and all societies   can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and   economic liberty  By making the world safer  we allow the people of the   world to make their own lives better  We will defend this just peace   against threats from terrorists and tyrants  We will preserve the peace   by building good relations among the great powers  We will extend the   peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent      Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental   commitment of the Federal Government  Today  that task has changed   dramatically  Enemies in the past needed great armies and great   industrial capabilities to endanger America  Now  shadowy networks of   individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less   than it costs to purchase a single tank  Terrorists are organized to   penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies   against us      To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal      from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and   cutting off terrorist financing  The war against terrorists of global   reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration  America will help   nations that need our assistance in combating terror  And America will   hold to account nations that are compromised by terror    because the   allies of terror are the enemies of civilization  The United States and   countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop   new home bases  Together  we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every   turn      The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism   and technology  Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking   weapons of mass destruction  and evidence indicates that they are doing   so with determination  The United States will not allow these efforts to   succeed  We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other   means of delivery  We will cooperate with other nations to deny    contain  and curtail our enemies  efforts to acquire dangerous   technologies  And  as a matter of common sense and self defense  America   will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed  We   cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best  So we must   be prepared to defeat our enemies  plans  using the best intelligence   and proceeding with deliberation  History will judge harshly those who   saw this coming danger but failed to act  In the new world we have   entered  the only path to safety is the path of action      As we defend the peace  we will also take advantage of an historic   opportunity to preserve the peace  Today  the international community   has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the   seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace   instead of continually prepare for war  Today  the world s great powers   find ourselves on the same side    united by common dangers of terrorist   violence and chaos  The United States will build on these common   interests to promote global security  We are also increasingly united by   common values  Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition  reaching   for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror  Chinese   leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of   national wealth  In time  they will find that social and political   freedom is the only source of national greatness  America will encourage   the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations    because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and   international order  We will strongly resist aggression from other great   powers    even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity    trade  and cultural advancement      Finally  the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend   the benefits of freedom across the globe  We will actively work to bring   the hope of democracy  development  free markets  and free trade to   every corner of the world  The events of September 11  2001  taught us   that weak states  like Afghanistan  can pose as great a danger to our   national interests as strong states  Poverty does not make poor people   into terrorists and murderers  Yet poverty  weak institutions  and   corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and   drug cartels within their borders      The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a   better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people  Free   trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies   out of poverty    so the United States will work with individual   nations  entire regions  and the entire global trading community to   build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity    The United States will deliver greater development assistance through   the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly    invest in their people  and encourage economic freedom  We will also   continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of   AIDS and other infectious diseases      In building a balance of power that favors freedom  the United States is   guided by the conviction that all nations have important   responsibilities  Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror    Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the   spread of weapons of mass destruction  Nations that seek international   aid must govern themselves wisely  so that aid is well spent  For   freedom to thrive  accountability must be expected and required      We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer    better world alone  Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply   the strength of freedom loving nations  The United States is committed   to lasting institutions like the United Nations  the World Trade   Organization  the Organization of American States  and NATO as well as   other long standing alliances  Coalitions of the willing can augment   these permanent institutions  In all cases  international obligations   are to be taken seriously  They are not to be undertaken symbolically to   rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment      Freedom is the non negotiable demand of human dignity  the birthright of   every person    in every civilization  Throughout history  freedom has   been threatened by war and terror  it has been challenged by the   clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants  and   it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease  Today  humanity   holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom s triumph over all   these foes  The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in   this great mission      I  Overview of America s International Strategy        Our Nation s cause has always been larger than our Nation s defense  We   fight  as we always fight  for a just peace    a peace that favors   liberty  We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists   and tyrants  We will preserve the peace by building good relations among   the great powers  And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and   open societies on every continent                 President Bush   West Point  New York   June 1  2002         The United States possesses unprecedented    and unequaled    strength   and influence in the world  Sustained by faith in the principles of   liberty  and the value of a free society  this position comes with   unparalleled responsibilities  obligations  and opportunity  The great   strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that   favors freedom      For most of the twentieth century  the world was divided by a great   struggle over ideas  destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and   equality      That great struggle is over  The militant visions of class  nation  and   race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and   discredited  America is now threatened less by conquering states than we   are by failing ones  We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by   catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few  We must   defeat these threats to our Nation  allies  and friends      This is also a time of opportunity for America  We will work to   translate this moment of influence into decades of peace  prosperity    and liberty  The U S  national security strategy will be based on a   distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our   values and our national interests  The aim of this strategy is to help   make the world not just safer but better  Our goals on the path to   progress are clear  political and economic freedom  peaceful relations   with other states  and respect for human dignity      And this path is not America s alone  It is open to all      To achieve these goals  the United States will        champion aspirations for human dignity        strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent   attacks against us and our friends        work with others to defuse regional conflicts        prevent our enemies from threatening us  our allies  and our   friends  with weapons of mass destruction        ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and   free trade        expand the circle of development by opening societies and building   the infrastructure of democracy        develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of   global power  and       transform America s national security institutions to meet the   challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century        II  Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity        Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the   language of right and wrong  I disagree  Different circumstances require   different methods  but not different moralities               President Bush   West Point  New York   June 1  2002         In pursuit of our goals  our first imperative is to clarify what we   stand for  the United States must defend liberty and justice because   these principles are right and true for all people everywhere  No nation   owns these aspirations  and no nation is exempt from them  Fathers and   mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live   free from poverty and violence  No people on earth yearn to be   oppressed  aspire to servitude  or eagerly await the midnight knock of   the secret police      America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human   dignity  the rule of law  limits on the absolute power of the state    free speech  freedom of worship  equal justice  respect for women    religious and ethnic tolerance  and respect for private property      These demands can be met in many ways  America s constitution has served   us well  Many other nations  with different histories and cultures    facing different circumstances  have successfully incorporated these   core principles into their own systems of governance  History has not   been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and   aspirations of their people      Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals  But even in   our worst moments  the principles enshrined in the Declaration of   Independence were there to guide us  As a result  America is not just a   stronger  but is a freer and more just society      Today  these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty  And   when openings arrive  we can encourage change    as we did in central   and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991  or in Belgrade in 2000  When   we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in   the Republic of Korea  and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin   America and Africa  we see examples of how authoritarian systems can   evolve  marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all   cherish      Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today    the national security strategy of the United States must start from   these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty      Our principles will guide our government s decisions about international   cooperation  the character of our foreign assistance  and the allocation   of resources  They will guide our actions and our words in international   bodies      We will        speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of   human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to   advance freedom        use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who   struggle non violently for it  ensuring that nations moving toward   democracy are rewarded for the steps they take        make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key   themes in our bilateral relations  seeking solidarity and cooperation   from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights   to move toward a better future  and       take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience   and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments        We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist   it      III  Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent   Attacks Against Us and Our Friends        Just three days removed from these events  Americans do not yet have   the distance of history  But our responsibility to history is already   clear  to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil  War has been   waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder  This nation is   peaceful  but fierce when stirred to anger  The conflict was begun on   the timing and terms of others  It will end in a way  and at an hour  of   our choosing               President Bush   Washington  D C   The National Cathedral    September 14  2001         The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of   global reach  The enemy is not a single political regime or person or   religion or ideology  The enemy is terrorism    premeditated    politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents      In many regions  legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a   lasting peace  Such grievances deserve to be  and must be  addressed   within a political process  But no cause justifies terror  The United   States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals   with them  We make no distinction between terrorists and those who   knowingly harbor or provide aid to them      The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in   our history  It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly   elusive enemy over an extended period of time  Progress will come   through the persistent accumulation of successes    some seen  some   unseen      Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can    and will  do against regimes that harbor  support  and use terrorism to   achieve their political goals  Afghanistan has been liberated  coalition   forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al Qaida  But it is not   only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists  Thousands of   trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America  South   America  Europe  Africa  the Middle East  and across Asia      Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist   organizations of global reach and attack their leadership  command    control  and communications  material support  and finances  This will   have a disabling effect upon the terrorists  ability to plan and operate      We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a   coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists  Once the regional   campaign localizes the threat to a particular state  we will help ensure   the state has the military  law enforcement  political  and financial   tools necessary to finish the task      The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the   financing of terrorism  We will identify and block the sources of   funding for terrorism  freeze the assets of terrorists and those who   support them  deny terrorists access to the international financial   system  protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists    and prevent the movement of terrorists  assets through alternative   financial networks      However  this campaign need not be sequential to be effective  the   cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we   seek      We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by        direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and   international power  Our immediate focus will be those terrorist   organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of   terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction    WMD  or their precursors        defending the United States  the American people  and our interests   at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it   reaches our borders  While the United States will constantly strive to   enlist the support of the international community  we will not hesitate   to act alone  if necessary  to exercise our right of self defense by   acting preemptively against such terrorists  to prevent them from doing   harm against our people and our country  and       denying further sponsorship  support  and sanctuary to terrorists   by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign   responsibilities        We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international   terrorism  This includes        using the full influence of the United States  and working closely   with allies and friends  to make clear that all acts of terrorism are   illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as   slavery  piracy  or genocide  behavior that no respectable government   can condone or support and all must oppose        supporting moderate and modern government  especially in the Muslim   world  to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote   terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation        diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by   enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources   on areas most at risk  and       using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of   information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of   those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism        While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also   strengthening America s homeland security to protect against and deter   attack      This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization   since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council   and the Department of Defense  Centered on a new Department of Homeland   Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental   reordering of the FBI  our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland   encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public   and the private sector      This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity  For example    emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with   terrorism but with all hazards  Our medical system will be strengthened   to manage not just bioterror  but all infectious diseases and   mass casualty dangers  Our border controls will not just stop   terrorists  but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic      While our focus is protecting America  we know that to defeat terrorism   in today s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends    Wherever possible  the United States will rely on regional organizations   and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism  Where   governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities  we   will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and   our allies can provide      As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan  we will continue to work   with international organizations such as the United Nations  as well as   non governmental organizations  and other countries to provide the   humanitarian  political  economic  and security assistance necessary to   rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people    threaten its neighbors  and provide a haven for terrorists     In the war against global terrorism  we will never forget that we are   ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life  Freedom   and fear are at war  and there will be no quick or easy end to this   conflict  In leading the campaign against terrorism  we are forging new    productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in   ways that meet the challenges of the twenty first century      IV  Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts        We build a world of justice  or we will live in a world of coercion    The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements   look so small               President Bush   Berlin  Germany   May 23  2002         Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional   disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering  In   an increasingly interconnected world  regional crisis can strain our   alliances  rekindle rivalries among the major powers  and create   horrifying affronts to human dignity  When violence erupts and states   falter  the United States will work with friends and partners to   alleviate suffering and restore stability      No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U S  action      direct or indirect    is warranted  We have finite political  economic    and military resources to meet our global priorities  The United States   will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind        The United States should invest time and resources into building   international relationships and institutions that can help manage local   crises when they emerge        The United States should be realistic about its ability to help   those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves  Where and when   people are ready to do their part  we will be willing to move decisively        Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will   apply these principles      The Israeli Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of   human suffering  because of America s close relationship with the state   of Israel and key Arab states  and because of that region s importance   to other global priorities of the United States  There can be no peace   for either side without freedom for both sides  America stands committed   to an independent and democratic Palestine  living beside Israel in   peace and security  Like all other people  Palestinians deserve a   government that serves their interests  and listens to their voices  and   counts their votes  The United States will continue to encourage all   parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and   comprehensive settlement to the conflict      The United States  the international donor community  and the World Bank   stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic   development  increased humanitarian assistance and a program to   establish  finance  and monitor a truly independent judiciary  If   Palestinians embrace democracy  and the rule of law  confront   corruption  and firmly reject terror  they can count on American support   for the creation of a Palestinian state      Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine    Permanent occupation threatens Israel s identity and democracy  So the   United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete   steps to support the emergence of a viable  credible Palestinian state    As there is progress towards security  Israel forces need to withdraw   fully to positions they held prior to September 28  2000  And consistent   with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee  Israeli settlement   activity in the occupied territories must stop  As violence subsides    freedom of movement should be restored  permitting innocent Palestinians   to resume work and normal life  The United States can play a crucial   role but  ultimately  lasting peace can only come when Israelis and   Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them      In South Asia  the United States has also emphasized the need for India   and Pakistan to resolve their disputes  This administration invested   time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and   Pakistan  These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a   constructive role when tensions in the region became acute  With   Pakistan  our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan s   choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more   open and tolerant society  The Administration sees India s potential to   become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty first century   and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly  Our   involvement in this regional dispute  building on earlier investments in   bilateral relations  looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan   that can help defuse military confrontation      Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and   respect for the rule of law  By tolerating ethnic minorities  respecting   the rule of law  and accepting open markets  Indonesia may be able to   employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its   neighbors out of poverty and desperation  It is the initiative by   Indonesia that allows U S  assistance to make a difference      In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with   countries that share our priorities  particularly Mexico  Brazil    Canada  Chile  and Colombia  Together we will promote a truly democratic   hemisphere where our integration advances security  prosperity    opportunity  and hope  We will work with regional institutions  such as   the Summit of the Americas process  the Organization of American States    OAS   and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of   the entire hemisphere      Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict  especially arising   from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices  This conflict   and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and   security of the United States  Therefore we have developed an active   strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies  enforce   their laws  defeat terrorist organizations  and cut off the supply of   drugs  while    as important    we work to reduce the demand for drugs   in our own country      In Colombia  we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist   groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking   activities that help finance the operations of such groups  We are   working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat   illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective   sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic   security to the Colombian people      In Africa  promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease  war    and desperate poverty  This threatens both a core value of the United   States    preserving human dignity    and our strategic priority      combating global terror  American interests and American principles    therefore  lead in the same direction  we will work with others for an   African continent that lives in liberty  peace  and growing prosperity    Together with our European allies  we must help strengthen Africa s   fragile states  help build indigenous capability to secure porous   borders  and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence   infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists      An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars   spread beyond borders to create regional war zones  Forming coalitions   of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to   confronting these emerging transnational threats      Africa s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that   focuses bilateral engagement  and builds coalitions of the willing  This   administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the   region        countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South   Africa  Nigeria  Kenya  and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement   and require focused attention        coordination with European allies and international institutions is   essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace   operations  and       Africa s capable reforming states and sub regional organizations   must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational   threats on a sustained basis        Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the   surest route to progress in sub Saharan Africa  where most wars are   conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically   waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference  The transition to   the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a   common responsibility for democratic political systems offers   opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent      V  Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us  Our Allies  and Our Friends   with Weapons of Mass Destruction        The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and   technology  When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear   weapons  along with ballistic missile technology    when that occurs    even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to   strike great nations  Our enemies have declared this very intention  and   have been caught seeking these terrible weapons  They want the   capability to blackmail us  or to harm us  or to harm our friends    and   we will oppose them with all our power               President Bush   West Point  New York   June 1  2002         The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States    with our   allies and friends    to emphasize deterrence of the enemy s use of   force  producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction  With the   collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War  our security   environment has undergone profound transformation      Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our   relationship with Russia  the dividends are evident  an end to the   balance of terror that divided us  an historic reduction in the nuclear   arsenals on both sides  and cooperation in areas such as   counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were   inconceivable      But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists    None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power   that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union  However  the nature and   motivations of these new adversaries  their determination to obtain   destructive powers hitherto available only to the world s strongest   states  and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass   destruction against us  make today s security environment more complex   and dangerous      In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue   states that  while different in important ways  share a number of   attributes  These states        brutalize their own people and squander their national resources   for the personal gain of the rulers        display no regard for international law  threaten their neighbors    and callously violate international treaties to which they are party        are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction  along with   other advanced military technology  to be used as threats or offensively   to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes        sponsor terrorism around the globe  and       reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything   for which it stands        At the time of the Gulf War  we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq s   designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against   Iran and its own people  but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear   weapons and biological agents  In the past decade North Korea has become   the world s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles  and has tested   increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal    Other rogue regimes seek nuclear  biological  and chemical weapons as   well  These states  pursuit of  and global trade in  such weapons has   become a looming threat to all nations      We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients   before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction   against the United States and our allies and friends  Our response must   take full advantage of strengthened alliances  the establishment of new   partnerships with former adversaries  innovation in the use of military   forces  modern technologies  including the development of an effective   missile defense system  and increased emphasis on intelligence   collection and analysis      Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes        Proactive counterproliferation efforts  We must deter and defend   against the threat before it is unleashed  We must ensure that key   capabilities    detection  active and passive defenses  and counterforce   capabilities    are integrated into our defense transformation and our   homeland security systems  Counterproliferation must also be integrated   into the doctrine  training  and equipping of our forces and those of   our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD armed   adversaries        Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and   terrorists from acquiring the materials  technologies and expertise   necessary for weapons of mass destruction  We will enhance diplomacy    arms control  multilateral export controls  and threat reduction   assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD  and when   necessary  interdict enabling technologies and materials  We will   continue to build coalitions to support these efforts  encouraging their   increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and   threat reduction programs  The recent G 8 agreement to commit up to  20   billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step   forward        Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD   use  whether by terrorists or hostile states  Minimizing the effects of   WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such   weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading   enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends  The United States   must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our   forces abroad  and to help friends and allies if they are attacked        It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of   this new threat  Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists  the   United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have   in the past  The inability to deter a potential attacker  the immediacy   of today s threats  and the magnitude of potential harm that could be   caused by our adversaries  choice of weapons  do not permit that option    We cannot let our enemies strike first        In the Cold War  especially following the Cuban missile crisis  we   faced a generally status quo  risk averse adversary  Deterrence was an   effective defense  But deterrence based only upon the threat of   retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states   more willing to take risks  gambling with the lives of their people  and   the wealth of their nations        In the Cold War  weapons of mass destruction were considered   weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who   used them  Today  our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons   of choice  For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and   military aggression against their neighbors  These weapons may also   allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our   allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior   of rogue states  Such states also see these weapons as their best means   of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States        Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a   terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the   targeting of innocents  whose so called soldiers seek martyrdom in death   and whose most potent protection is statelessness  The overlap between   states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to   action        For centuries  international law recognized that nations need not suffer   an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves   against forces that present an imminent danger of attack  Legal scholars   and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption   on the existence of an imminent threat    most often a visible   mobilization of armies  navies  and air forces preparing to attack      We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and   objectives of today s adversaries  Rogue states and terrorists do not   seek to attack us using conventional means  They know such attacks would   fail  Instead  they rely on acts of terrorism and  potentially  the use   of weapons of mass destruction    weapons that can be easily concealed   and delivered covertly and without warning      The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian   population  in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law   of warfare  As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11  2001    mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and   these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired   and used weapons of mass destruction      The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions   to counter a sufficient threat to our national security  The greater the   threat  the greater is the risk of inaction    and the more compelling   the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves  even if   uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy s attack  To   forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries  the United   States will  if necessary  act preemptively      The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging   threats  nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression    Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek   the world s most destructive technologies  the United States cannot   remain idle while dangers gather      We will always proceed deliberately  weighing the consequences of our   actions  To support preemptive options  we will        build better  more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide   timely  accurate information on threats  wherever they may emerge        coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the   most dangerous threats  and       continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to   conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results        The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat   to the United States or our allies and friends  The reasons for our   actions will be clear  the force measured  and the cause just      VI  Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and   Free Trade         When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a   privileged few  no amount    no amount    of development aid is ever   enough  When nations respect their people  open markets  invest in   better health and education  every dollar of aid  every dollar of trade   revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively               President Bush   Monterrey  Mexico   March 22  2002         A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing   prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world  Economic growth   supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher   incomes  It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty  spurs   economic and legal reform  and the fight against corruption  and it   reinforces the habits of liberty      We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America s   shores  All governments are responsible for creating their own economic   policies and responding to their own economic challenge  We will use our   economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of   policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic   growth  including        pro growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business   investment  innovation  and entrepreneurial activity        tax policies    particularly lower marginal tax rates    that   improve incentives for work and investment        rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are   confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic   endeavors        strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most   efficient use        sound fiscal policies to support business activity        investments in health and education that improve the well being and   skills of the labor force and population as a whole  and       free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the   diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and   opportunity        The lessons of history are clear  market economies  not   command and control economies with the heavy hand of government  are the   best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty  Policies that further   strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for   all economies    industrialized countries  emerging markets  and the   developing world      A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U S    national security interests  We want our allies to have strong economies   for their own sake  for the sake of the global economy  and for the sake   of global security  European efforts to remove structural barriers in   their economies are particularly important in this regard  as are   Japan s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of   non performing loans in the Japanese banking system  We will continue to   use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners      including through the Group of Seven  G 7     to discuss policies they   are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher   global economic growth      Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic   growth  International flows of investment capital are needed to expand   the productive potential of these economies  These flows allow emerging   markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise   living standards and reduce poverty  Our long term objective should be a   world in which all countries have investment grade credit ratings that   allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in   their future      We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve   access to larger capital flows at lower cost  To this end  we will   continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial   markets  We will work actively with other countries  the International   Monetary Fund  IMF   and the private sector to implement the G 7 Action   Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and   more effectively resolving them when they occur      The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from   occurring  and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing   so  We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy   conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on   achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy    exchange rate policy  and financial sector policy      The concept of  free trade  arose as a moral principle even before it   became a pillar of economics  If you can make something that others   value  you should be able to sell it to them  If others make something   that you value  you should be able to buy it  This is real freedom  the   freedom for a person    or a nation    to make a living  To promote free   trade  the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy        Seize the global initiative  The new global trade negotiations we   helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda    especially in agriculture  manufacturing  and services  targeted for   completion in 2005  The United States has led the way in completing the   accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade   Organization  We will assist Russia s preparations to join the WTO        Press regional initiatives  The United States and other democracies   in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of   the Americas  targeted for completion in 2005  This year the United   States will advocate market access negotiations with its partners    targeted on agriculture  industrial goods  services  investment  and   government procurement  We will also offer more opportunity to the   poorest continent  Africa  starting with full use of the preferences   allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act  and leading to free   trade        Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements  Building on the   free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001  the Administration   will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and   Singapore  Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of   developed and developing countries in all regions of the world    Initially  Central America  Southern Africa  Morocco  and Australia will   be our principal focal points        Renew the executive congressional partnership  Every   administration s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with   Congress  After a gap of 8 years  the Administration reestablished   majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing   Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for   developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002  This Administration will   work with Congress to enact new bilateral  regional  and global trade   agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade   Promotion Authority        Promote the connection between trade and development  Trade   policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights    competition  the rule of law  investment  the spread of knowledge  open   societies  the efficient allocation of resources  and regional   integration    all leading to growth  opportunity  and confidence in   developing countries  The United States is implementing The Africa   Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market access for nearly all goods   produced in the 35 countries of sub Saharan Africa  We will make more   use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue   to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer   countries take advantage of these opportunities  Beyond market access    the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public   health  We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are   flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical   medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV AIDS  tuberculosis  and   malaria        Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices    Commerce depends on the rule of law  international trade depends on   enforceable agreements  Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing   disputes with the European Union  Canada  and Mexico and to make a   global effort to address new technology  science  and health regulations   that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture  Laws   against unfair trade practices are often abused  but the international   community must be able to address genuine concerns about government   subsidies and dumping  International industrial espionage which   undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred        Help domestic industries and workers adjust  There is a sound   statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used   in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the   American steel industry  The benefits of free trade depend upon the   enforcement of fair trading practices  These safeguards help ensure that   the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American   workers  Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the   change and dynamism of open markets        Protect the environment and workers  The United States must foster   economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with   widening prosperity  We will incorporate labor and environmental   concerns into U S  trade negotiations  creating a healthy  network    between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO  and use the   International Labor Organization  trade preference programs  and trade   talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade        Enhance energy security  We will strengthen our own energy security   and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our   allies  trading partners  and energy producers to expand the sources and   types of global energy supplied  especially in the Western Hemisphere    Africa  Central Asia  and the Caspian region  We will also continue to   work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient   technologies        Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize   greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth  containing   them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the   global climate  Our overall objective is to reduce America s greenhouse   gas emissions relative to the size of our economy  cutting such   emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10   years  by the year 2012  Our strategies for attaining this goal will be   to        remain committed to the basic U N  Framework Convention for   international cooperation        obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of   the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to   companies that can show real cuts        develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission   reductions        promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology  as   well as nuclear power    which produces no greenhouse gas emissions    while also improving fuel economy for U S  cars and trucks        increase spending on research and new conservation technologies  to   a total of  4 5 billion    the largest sum being spent on climate change   by any country in the world and a  700 million increase over last year s   budget  and       assist developing countries  especially the major greenhouse gas   emitters such as China and India  so that they will have the tools and   resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and   better path        VII  Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building   the Infrastructure of Democracy        In World War II we fought to make the world safer  then worked to   rebuild it  As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror  we   must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens               President Bush   Washington  D C   Inter American   Development Bank    March 14  2002         A world where some live in comfort and plenty  while half of the human   race lives on less than  2 a day  is neither just nor stable  Including   all of the world s poor in an expanding circle of development    and   opportunity    is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of   U S  international policy      Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic   growth in the poorest countries  Worse  development aid has often served   to prop up failed policies  relieving the pressure for reform and   perpetuating misery  Results of aid are typically measured in dollars   spent by donors  not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction   achieved by recipients  These are the indicators of a failed strategy      Working with other nations  the United States is confronting this   failure  We forged a new consensus at the U N  Conference on Financing   for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance    and   the strategies to achieve those objectives    must change      This Administration s goal is to help unleash the productive potential   of individuals in all nations  Sustained growth and poverty reduction is   impossible without the right national policies  Where governments have   implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels   of assistance  The United States and other developed countries should   set an ambitious and specific target  to double the size of the world s   poorest economies within a decade      The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to   achieve this goal        Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of   national reform  We propose a 50 percent increase in the core   development assistance given by the United States  While continuing our   present programs  including humanitarian assistance based on need alone    these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge   Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly  invest   in their people  and encourage economic freedom  Governments must fight   corruption  respect basic human rights  embrace the rule of law  invest   in health care and education  follow responsible economic policies  and   enable entrepreneurship  The Millennium Challenge Account will reward   countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those   that have not to implement reforms        Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development   banks in raising living standards  The United States is committed to a   comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other   multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of   the world s poor  We have reversed the downward trend in U S    contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U S    contributions to the International Development Association  IDA     the   World Bank s fund for the poorest countries    and the African   Development Fund  The key to raising living standards and reducing   poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth  especially   in the poorest countries  We will continue to press the multilateral   development banks to focus on activities that increase economic   productivity  such as improvements in education  health  rule of law    and private sector development  Every project  every loan  every grant   must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in   developing countries        Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development   assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world s   poor  When it comes to economic development  what really matters is that   more children are getting a better education  more people have access to   health care and clean water  or more workers can find jobs to make a   better future for their families  We have a moral obligation to measure   the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering   results  For this reason  we will continue to demand that our own   development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral   development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for   achieving those goals  Thanks to U S  leadership  the recent IDA   replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation   system that measures recipient countries  progress  For the first time    donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the   achievement of actual development results  and part of the U S    contribution is linked in this way  We will strive to make sure that the   World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this   progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything   that these institutions do        Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in   the form of grants instead of loans  Greater use of results based grants   is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments    particularly in the social sectors  without saddling them with   ever larger debt burdens  As a result of U S  leadership  the recent IDA   agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the   poorest countries for education  HIV AIDS  health  nutrition  water    sanitation  and other human needs  Our goal is to build on that progress   by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development   banks  We will also challenge universities  nonprofits  and the private   sector to match government efforts by using grants to support   development projects that show results        Open societies to commerce and investment  Trade and investment are   the real engines of economic growth  Even if government aid increases    most money for development must come from trade  domestic capital  and   foreign investment  An effective strategy must try to expand these flows   as well  Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national   security strategy        Secure public health  The scale of the public health crisis in poor   countries is enormous  In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics   like HIV AIDS  malaria  and tuberculosis  growth and development will be   threatened until these scourges can be contained  Resources from the   developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest   governance  which supports prevention programs and provides effective   local infrastructure  The United States has strongly backed the new   global fund for HIV AIDS organized by U N  Secretary General Kofi Annan   and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for   treatment and care  The United States already contributes more than   twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor  If the   global fund demonstrates its promise  we will be ready to give even more        Emphasize education  Literacy and learning are the foundation of   democracy and development  Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources   are devoted to education  This proportion should grow  The United States   will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20   percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher   training in Africa  The United States can also bring information   technology to these societies  many of whose education systems have been   devastated by AIDS        Continue to aid agricultural development  New technologies    including biotechnology  have enormous potential to improve crop yields   in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water    Using sound science  the United States should help bring these benefits   to the 800 million people  including 300 million children  who still   suffer from hunger and malnutrition        VIII  Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers   of Global Power        We have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the 17th   century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead   of prepare for war               President Bush   West Point  New York   June 1  2002         America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions    as   broad as practicable    of states able and willing to promote a balance   of power that favors freedom  Effective coalition leadership requires   clear priorities  an appreciation of others  interests  and consistent   consultations among partners with a spirit of humility      There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can   accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies   and friends in Canada and Europe  Europe is also the seat of two of the   strongest and most able international institutions in the world  the   North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   which has  since its   inception  been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter European   security  and the European Union  EU   our partner in opening world   trade      The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO  as NATO itself   recognized when it invoked its Article V self defense clause for the   first time  NATO s core mission    collective defense of the   transatlantic alliance of democracies    remains  but NATO must develop   new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new   circumstances  NATO must build a capability to field  at short notice    highly mobile  specially trained forces whenever they are needed to   respond to a threat against any member of the alliance      The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened    creating coalitions under NATO s own mandate  as well as contributing to   mission based coalitions  To achieve this  we must        expand NATO s membership to those democratic nations willing and   able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests        ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate   combat contributions to make in coalition warfare        develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become   effective multinational fighting forces        take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of   scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that   they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities        streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to   meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of   training  integrating  and experimenting with new force configurations    and       maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as   we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces        If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes  the rewards will be a   partnership as central to the security and interests of its member   states as was the case during the Cold War  We will sustain a common   perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to   take common action in defense of our nations and their interests  At the   same time  we welcome our European allies  efforts to forge a greater   foreign policy and defense identity with the EU  and commit ourselves to   close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO  We   cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of   transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come      The attacks of September 11 energized America s Asian alliances    Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an   attack on Australia itself  following that historic decision with the   dispatch of some of the world s finest combat forces for Operation   Enduring Freedom  Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented   levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist   attack  We have deepened cooperation on counter terrorism with our   alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received   invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand      The war against terrorism has proven that America s alliances in Asia   not only underpin regional peace and stability  but are flexible and   ready to deal with new challenges  To enhance our Asian alliances and   friendships  we will          look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and   global affairs based on our common interests  our common values  and our   close defense and diplomatic cooperation        work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while   preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of   the region over the longer term        build on 50 years of U S  Australian alliance cooperation as we   continue working together to resolve regional and global problems    as   we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora        maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our   allies  our requirements  our technological advances  and the strategic   environment  and       build on stability provided by these alliances  as well as with   institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation   forum  to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage   change in this dynamic region        We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power   competition  Several potential great powers are now in the midst of   internal transition    most importantly Russia  India  and China  In all   three cases  recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly   global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape      With Russia  we are already building a new strategic relationship based   on a central reality of the twenty first century  the United States and   Russia are no longer strategic adversaries  The Moscow Treaty on   Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a   critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive    long term relations with the Euro Atlantic community and the United   States  Russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their   country s current weakness and the policies    internal and external      needed to reverse those weaknesses  They understand  increasingly  that   Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that   Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas      United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to   refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and   challenges  We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the   global war on terrorism  We are facilitating Russia s entry into the   World Trade Organization  without lowering standards for accession  to   promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations  We have   created the NATO Russia Council with the goal of deepening security   cooperation among Russia  our European allies  and ourselves  We will   continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the   former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable   neighborhood will reinforce Russia s growing commitment to integration   into the Euro Atlantic community      At the same time  we are realistic about the differences that still   divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to   build an enduring strategic partnership  Lingering distrust of our   motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our   relations  Russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market   democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons   of mass destruction remain matters of great concern  Russia s very   weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation  Nevertheless  those   opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years    or even   decades      The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral   relationship with India based on a conviction that U S  interests   require a strong relationship with India  We are the two largest   democracies  committed to political freedom protected by representative   government  India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well  We   have a common interest in the free flow of commerce  including through   the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean  Finally  we share an interest   in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia      Differences remain  including over the development of India s nuclear   and missile programs  and the pace of India s economic reforms  But   while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about   India  today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with   which we have common strategic interests  Through a strong partnership   with India  we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic   future      The United States relationship with China is an important part of our   strategy to promote a stable  peaceful  and prosperous Asia Pacific   region  We welcome the emergence of a strong  peaceful  and prosperous   China  The democratic development of China is crucial to that future    Yet  a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst   features of the Communist legacy  China s leaders have not yet made the   next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state    In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its   neighbors in the Asia Pacific region  China is following an outdated   path that  in the end  will hamper its own pursuit of national   greatness  In time  China will find that social and political freedom is   the only source of that greatness      The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing   China  We already cooperate well where our interests overlap  including   the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean   peninsula  Likewise  we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan   and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and   similar transitional concerns  Shared health and environmental threats    such as the spread of HIV AIDS  challenge us to promote jointly the   welfare of our citizens      Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become   more open with information  promote the development of civil society    and enhance individual human rights  China has begun to take the road to   political openness  permitting many personal freedoms and conducting   village level elections  yet remains strongly committed to national   one party rule by the Communist Party  To make that nation truly   accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations  however  much work   remains to be done  Only by allowing the Chinese people to think    assemble  and worship freely can China reach its full potential      Our important trade relationship will benefit from China s entry into   the World Trade Organization  which will create more export   opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers  workers    and companies  China is our fourth largest trading partner  with over    100 billion in annual two way trade  The power of market principles and   the WTO s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance   openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic   protections for commerce and for citizens  There are  however  other   areas in which we have profound disagreements  Our commitment to the   self defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one  Human   rights is another  We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation   commitments  We will work to narrow differences where they exist  but   not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree      The events of September 11  2001  fundamentally changed the context for   relations between the United States and other main centers of global   power  and opened vast  new opportunities  With our long standing allies   in Europe and Asia  and with leaders in Russia  India  and China  we   must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships   become routine and unproductive      Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge  We   can build fruitful habits of consultation  quiet argument  sober   analysis  and common action  In the long term  these are the practices   that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open   the path of progress      IX  Transform America s National Security Institutions to Meet the   Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty First Century        Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity  They did not touch   its source  America is successful because of the hard work  creativity    and enterprise of our people               President Bush   Washington  D C   Joint Session of Congress    September 20  2001         The major institutions of American national security were designed in a   different era to meet different requirements  All of them must be   transformed      It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength    We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge  Our military s   highest priority is to defend the United States  To do so effectively    our military must        assure our allies and friends        dissuade future military competition        deter threats against U S  interests  allies  and friends  and       decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails        The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces  and their   forward presence  have maintained the peace in some of the world s most   strategically vital regions  However  the threats and enemies we must   confront have changed  and so must our forces  A military structured to   deter massive Cold War era armies must be transformed to focus more on   how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might   occur  We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational   challenges      The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound   symbols of the U S  commitments to allies and friends  Through our   willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others    the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of   power that favors freedom  To contend with uncertainty and to meet the   many security challenges we face  the United States will require bases   and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia  as   well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment   of U S  forces      Before the war in Afghanistan  that area was low on the list of major   planning contingencies  Yet  in a very short time  we had to operate   across the length and breadth of that remote nation  using every branch   of the armed forces  We must prepare for more such deployments by   developing assets such as advanced remote sensing  long range precision   strike capabilities  and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces    This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the   ability to defend the homeland  conduct information operations  ensure   U S  access to distant theaters  and protect critical U S    infrastructure and assets in outer space      Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new   approaches to warfare  strengthening joint operations  exploiting U S    intelligence advantages  and taking full advantage of science and   technology  We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is   run  especially in financial management and recruitment and retention    Finally  while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight   the war on terrorism  the goal must be to provide the President with a   wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of   coercion against the United States  our allies  and our friends      We know from history that deterrence can fail  and we know from   experience that some enemies cannot be deterred  The United States must   and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy      whether a state or non state actor    to impose its will on the United   States  our allies  or our friends  We will maintain the forces   sufficient to support our obligations  and to defend freedom  Our forces   will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a   military build up in hopes of surpassing  or equaling  the power of the   United States      Intelligence    and how we use it    is our first line of defense   against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states  Designed   around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive    fixed object    the Soviet bloc    the intelligence community is coping   with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of   targets      We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to   keep pace with the nature of these threats  Intelligence must be   appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems   and coordinated with our allies and friends  We need to protect the   capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the   knowledge of how best to surprise us  Those who would harm us also seek   the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and   to maximize injury      We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide   integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security  Since   the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted   inside the United States  we must also ensure the proper fusion of   information between intelligence and law enforcement      Initiatives in this area will include        strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence   to lead the development and actions of the Nation s foreign intelligence   capabilities        establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides   seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing   the nation and our allies        continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to   sustain our intelligence advantage        investing in future capabilities while working to protect them   through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence   capabilities  and       collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the   government with all source analysis        As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend   America s interests  it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other   nations  We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding   sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy  The State   Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with   other governments  And in this new era  its people and institutions must   be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations   and international institutions  Officials trained mainly in   international politics must also extend their reach to understand   complex issues of domestic governance around the world  including public   health  education  law enforcement  the judiciary  and public diplomacy      Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations  civil   wars  and other humanitarian catastrophes  As humanitarian relief   requirements are better understood  we must also be able to help build   police forces  court systems  and legal codes  local and provincial   government institutions  and electoral systems  Effective international   cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals  backed by American   readiness to play our part      Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out   to others  we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to   public information efforts that can help people around the world learn   about and understand America  The war on terrorism is not a clash of   civilizations  It does  however  reveal the clash inside a civilization    a battle for the future of the Muslim world  This is a struggle of ideas   and this is an area where America must excel      We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet   our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired   by the potential for investigations  inquiry  or prosecution by the   International Criminal Court  ICC   whose jurisdiction does not extend   to Americans and which we do not accept  We will work together with   other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and   cooperation  through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral   agreements that will protect U S  nationals from the ICC  We will   implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act  whose   provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U S    personnel and officials      We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the   right level and allocation of government spending on national security    The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this   war  At home  our most important priority is to protect the homeland for   the American people      Today  the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is   diminishing  In a globalized world  events beyond America s borders have   a greater impact inside them  Our society must be open to people  ideas    and goods from across the globe  The characteristics we most cherish      our freedom  our cities  our systems of movement  and modern life    are   vulnerable to terrorism  This vulnerability will persist long after we   bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks    As time passes  individuals may gain access to means of destruction that   until now could be wielded only by armies  fleets  and squadrons  This   is a new condition of life  We will adjust to it and thrive    in spite   of it      In exercising our leadership  we will respect the values  judgment  and   interests of our friends and partners  Still  we will be prepared to act   apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require  When we   disagree on particulars  we will explain forthrightly the grounds for   our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives  We will not allow   such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together  with   our allies and our friends  our shared fundamental interests and values      Ultimately  the foundation of American strength is at home  It is in the   skills of our people  the dynamism of our economy  and the resilience of   our institutions  A diverse  modern society has inherent  ambitious    entrepreneurial energy  Our strength comes from what we do with that   energy  That is where our national security begins     \n",

      "  Over on Arstechnica  www arstechnica com  I saw mention of a Wired article that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and respect for its users     There is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at    True to form  industrious third party developers saw that they could gain a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in their applications  Apple s private menu extras APIs were reverse engineered and leveraged to great effect  The architecture was so popular that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras  third party or otherwise  was in development   All of that changed with the release of Jaguar  but not because the private APIs had changed  If they had  third party developers would have updated their applications to work with the new APIs  as they have resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first place   But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly exclude all non Apple menu extras  Other parts of the API did not change  But when a menu extra is loaded  it is compared to a hard coded list of  known  menu extras from Apple  If the menu extra is not on that list  it is not allowed to load   It s easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer s sweat soaked gyrations as he chants  developers  developers  developers    but Microsoft clearly understands something that Apple is still struggling with  It is in a platform vendor s best interest to encourage development for its platform  In Apple s case  this doesn t mean that they have to bend over backwards to make every single system service and UI element  pluggable  via public APIs  That s clearly a lot of work  and not something that needs to be the number one priority for an OS in its infancy  And in the meantime  if third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the desired functionality to be added in  unsupported  ways  then they must be prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions   But for Apple to go out of its way  to actually expend developer effort  to stop these third party developers  while still failing to provide a supported alternative  is incredibly foolish      \n",

persons mistake  the content is the users  communications   its anything and everything   avg person could easily send  half dozen pics to a dozen people a day   mainly humorous i d guess  who  cares if content is trivial in nature  picture speaks a thousand words   This does nothing to answer my question   I  do  care about content   Hell  if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day  I d have a different opinion of this   I just am not convinced that they will  stupid or not    While a picture may be worth a thousand words  and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made   how many people do you know who communicate by pictures   Sure  it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism  but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something   I don t buy it   For most messages  text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism   For some messages  pictures do the job  but I would say not nearly as often as words   Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and such are games   Because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across    misc ramblings  i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same  thing about  1 hour photo  processing   trivial  who needs it  i get better  resultion elswhere   and yet  it had great decentralizing impact   the plant  had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation   the digital camera   and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of  decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion  which will put the  photo giants to bed  and change the world in a meaningful way   also  SMS  didn t take off because its easy  it took off because it costs less   its  greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the  profitabilty  of their SMS  traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth   in reality   SMS cannibilizes the voice rev s they bought their networks to handle   Again  this is the same argument my colleague made  along with  you just don t understand kids today  and they ll run with this     I wasn t saying that MMS wouldn t take off because it wasn t high quality or that it wasn t easy   I was saying that I couldn t see why people would use it in a way that  changed the face of communications    I m looking for the compelling reason  even if it s a stupid one  why people would want to do this   Sure  if they integrate cameras into the phone  and the quality improves  even only marginally  I can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people   But  mostly  I don t see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone s email address  or putting together an online  or offline  photoalbum   I don t think 1 hour photos are trivial   People want to see their own pics right away  and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots   That s one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on   The instant view part   I m guessing your argument is that people not only want  instant view   but also  instant show    Which is what this service offers   I m not convinced that most people want  instant show    I think people like to package their pictures and show them   That s why people put together fancy albums  and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture   Sure  occasionally  instant show  is nice  but it s just  nice  on occasion   I still can t see how it becomes a integral messaging method   What s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another   There has to be  some  benefit  even if it s silly if people are going to flock to it   I m searching    no one has given me a straight answer yet   The  only  really intriguing idea I ve heard about things like MMS lately are Dan Gillmor s assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen  and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones  from all different angles  and those photos tell the real story of what happened   before the press even gets there   Willing to be proven wrong  Mike  PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are  then MMS is  never  going to catch on    \n",

      " The Times   September 06  2002  Hitler style applicant welcomed by parties By Roger Boyes    MANAGERS of Germany s political parties are having difficulty explaining their enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed largely from Mein Kampf  Hitler s personal manifesto  The incident illustrates how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an election campaign  even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to those of the F hrer    Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the present Chancellor   said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union headquarters in Ingolstadt   Chancellor Schr der is doing nothing to stop the flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland   said the letter  signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald   The CSU immediately spotted a potential member   Many thanks for your nice thoughts   replied the local party manager  who enclosed an application for membership   The letter used chunks of Hitler s book  which is still banned in Germany  History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries     The strongest  the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of existence  only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive   the letter writer said   So called humanity is melting like snow in the March sun   Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf  which was written while Hitler was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923   Similar letters  also using the Nazi leader s words  were sent to the other political parties and drew sympathetic responses   I read your letter with great interest and pleasure   the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in Cologne  said    Great that you want to join us   enthused the Green Party headquarters  The Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball at which Hans  Dietrich Genscher  the former Foreign Minister  would be the star guest  The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by Gerhard Schr der  the Chancellor    I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right wing extremism   said the letter writer  who was in fact the Cologne novelist Rainer Popp   I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic    For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special Branch to knock on my door  Instead only the postman called   with packets of election material from zealous political headquarters   Herr Popp said    I was stunned that political parties could react in this way   I reckon I would have had the same response if I had signed the letter  Adolf Hitler                                  Yahoo  Groups Sponsor                           4 DVDs Free  s p Join Now                                                                            To unsubscribe from this group  send an email to  forteana unsubscribe egroups com    Your use of Yahoo  Groups is subject to    \n",

      "   Begin forwarded message     From  Ian Andrew Bell  hello ianbell com    Date  Wed Oct 9  2002  11 16 09 PM US Pacific   To  mike michaelmoore com   Cc  foib ianbell com   Subject   Re   Bowling for Columbine   Opens This Friday     Michael      Why is it that people who consider voting in an election an   inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message     Don t get me wrong    I think this is the case   People will go to   see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to   express their malice and discontent towards not only the present   regime in America  but also the corrupt  empty  shallow pantomime   which cast them into power      In reality  today the voting that takes place via the act of   consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth   and dimpling the appropriate chad  or some other such convoluted act   of free democratic expression      Why   Because in America  they believe in dollars   Dollars don t lie     In practise  they are the last frontier of truth in America    universally accepted as expressions of fear  desire  passion  and   need   Compared to the swing of the almighty buck  and Jeb Bush knows   this  a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning      Given that fact  I modestly propose an entirely new  though wholly   logical  extension to the current democratic system in place in   America      I propose we augment  and effectively replace  the electoral system   with a political stock market   We should accept that Politicians are   entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in America  and   embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects   their intent   A politician should issue a constant number of shares   dependent upon his tenure in government   Those shares should be   traded on an open exchange  say the G R E E D   short  of course  for   the  Global Realists  Electoral Exchange    Democratic     Politicians   we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their   ability to maintain office grows   As the truth about their embezzling   campaign funds for weekend trips to Maui with their interns is   revealed  of course  their fortunes will fall      This represents an opportunity for the market forces    those same   forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal   protest    to voice their opinion on the quality of America s   governance during the intervening four years between elections    Elections themselves will in effect become meaningless  as they are   now  since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each   and every congressman  senator  and presidential candidate      Just think of the coverage that could be given on MSNBC    Strom   Thurman  STROM  news   quotes  was down 15  today on fears that his   latest heart operation will render him unable to attend Senate Armed   Services committee meetings until November     This would provide   rejuvenating content to the econo political news sector  which has   found post economic bubble coverage to be both tiresome and   deoressing   The establishment of this new stock exchange would of   course create jobs for newly unemployed  and governmentally retrained    IT systems engineers who could  after passing the electoral securities   exam  become floor traders      This would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which   candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their   multi billion dollar campaigns   The requirement for the support of   legions of spin doctors  permanent campaign managers  and investor   relations personnel would also create jobs    perhaps even a new   practice for Ernst   Young  Arthur Anderson  et al   Insider trading   scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch   Martha Stewart as an unwitting beneficiary  thus spreading her   influence to politics      Dividends  if there are any on record  at the close of a politician s   career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings    Pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support   necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the Beltway set    Union funds  brokerages  and even pump and dump houses could benefit   from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the   Southeast  and the Bush Governmet would be allowed to place Social   Security bets where they really mattered    investors who lose their   retirement  life savings  and support could rest assured that they   were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors      Although there s no way to protect any of these for Worldcom like   crashes  ambitious  inspired  District Attorneys could file criminal   suits against Candidates and Campaign Managers who underperform   expectations  thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty      instead  they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves      On the whole  I believe the system could work   I could certainly work   as well as our beloved securities trading industry and  given the   American electoral system s success at effectively expressing the will   of the people  it certainly couldn t do any worse        In the meantime  Mike  I think I ll go see your movie and try to   depose the President       Ian          On Wednesday  October 9  2002  at 03 53 PM  Michael Moore s Mailing   List wrote       October 9  2002       My Film   Bowling for Columbine   Opens This Friday       Dear friends  fans  and fellow evildoers        I am very happy and excited to tell you that this Friday  October 11     my    new    film   Bowling for Columbine   will open in New York and Los Angeles        It is  I promise  the last thing the Bushies want projected on the    movie    screens across America this week  The film is  first and foremost  a    devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for    profit    and power    and no one  in all the advance screenings I have    attended  has    left the theatre with anything short of rage  I truly believe this    film has    the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do    something        This is not good news for Junior and Company  Not when they are    trying to    drag us into another war  Not when a crazed sniper is exercising his    constitutional right to own a high powered rifle  Not when John    Ashcroft is    still prohibiting the FBI from looking through the gun background    check    files to see if any of the 19 hijackers or their associates purchased    any    weapons prior to 9 11    because THAT  we are told  would  violate     these    terrorists  sacred Second Amendment rights        Yes  I believe this movie can create a lot of havoc    but I will    need ALL    of you to help me do this  Are you game        Last February 5th  I wrote to tell you about a book I had written and    how    the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to    publish    anything critical of Bush after 9 11  I appealed to you to save     Stupid    White Men  from the shredder and to go out and buy it  I promised you    would    not regret it  and that the book would not only be a great read but an    important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of George W  Bush        Within 24 hours  the book went to  1 on the Amazon best seller list     By the    fifth day  the book was already into its 9th printing  The publisher    was    torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money     Greed won    out  and this Sunday the book enters its 31st week on the New York    Times    best seller list    and its 32nd printing  This is all because of    you  my    crazy and loyal friends  You made this happen  against all the odds        Now I would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work      Bowling    for Columbine   It s a movie that many critics have already called my    best    film to date  They may be right  It is certainly the most provocative    thing    I have ever done  I have spent three years on it and  I have to say     it    cuts    deeper  harder and funnier that anything I have given you so far        The movie opens this Friday in New York and Los Angeles  and then in    8 more    cities next week  How it does in these first ten cities will determine    whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it  That is the    nutty    way    our films are released  If it doesn t have a big opening weekend  you    can    kiss the film good bye  Therefore  this weekend  this film must be    seen by    millions of Americans  Can you help me make that happen         Bowling for Columbine  is not a film simply about guns or school    shootings     That is only the starting point for my 2 hour journey into the dark    soul of    a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of    violence     both at home and around the world  With this movie I have broadened my    canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the 21st    century  a nation that seems hell bent on killing first and asking    questions    later  It is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and    terrorism against our own poor  and how we have created a culture of    fear    that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore  And it s a    devastating comedy        This film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts  No film has    EVER    said the things I am saying in  Bowling for Columbine   I expect to be    attacked  I expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of    retribution  I expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many    to    swallow        This is why I need your help  Movies live or die based on what    happens at    the box office the first weekend of its release  I need you  if you    live in    the New York or L A  area  to go see  Bowling for Columbine  this    Friday    and    Saturday    and take as many family members and friends with you as    possible  I guarantee you will not be disappointed    and you may    just see    one of the best films of the year        Monday night in Times Square   Bowling for Columbine  had its    premiere  The    crowd was amazing  as it was this past Saturday night at the Chicago    Film    Festival  The audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud    throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line        The hate mail  the threats  the promises of retribution have already    started    to roll in to the distributor of this movie  United Artists  They are    not    backing down  But how long will this last  I need all of you in the    New    York    tri state and southern California areas to go see  Bowling for    Columbine     THIS weekend    the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when    it    comes to your town  A strong opening not only means that the rest of    America    will see this film  it means that a good number of people who see it    are    going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved     If it    does poorly  I will have a difficult time finding the funding for the    movie    I want to make next    a film about 9 11 and how Bush is using that    tragic    day as a cover for his right wing agenda        Don t let that happen  Don t let the NRA have one more success by    stopping    the wider distribution of this movie  And  together  let us not remain    silent in our opposition to Bush s phony war against Iraq        If you live in New York  you can see it at the Lincoln Plaza  the    Sunshine    and the Loews 19th St  In L A   you can catch it at the Sunset 5  the    Westwood Regent  Laemmle Sunset  Laemmle Towncenter  Encino   Landmark    Rialto  Pasadena   and Regal University  Irvine   Also  please    forward this    to your other friends and tell them to go see  Bowling for Columbine     this    weekend        And finally  don t miss our new website www bowlingforcolumbine com       Thank you for your help with this  I feel so honored and privileged    to have    so many people interested in my work  Last January I was getting    70 000    hits    a month on my website  Last month  I got 17 million hits  This alone    speaks    volumes about the vast majority all of us belong to who are sick and    tired    of what is going on and are longing for an alternative source of    information        I hope that you enjoy  Bowling for Columbine         Thank you again          Yours

      "     The Disappearing Alliance By Dale Franks 10 08 2002   For over two generations  the countries of Western Europe have been our closest allies  We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  We celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism   Tragically  a generation from now  we may be bitter adversaries   Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed  progressive transnationalism   The key doctrines of this form of post communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas  Among these are the deconstruction of nationalism  the promotion of post nationalist ideas of citizenship  i e  a  global  citizenry   a redefinition of democracy  and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the United Nations   The European Union  itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by European nations  is post democratic  While there is a European Parliament  the EU s power resides mainly in the unelected European Commission  EC  and its unelected President  who face few limits to their power  Instead of a limited  consensual form of government  where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws  the EU has an appointed  oligarchic executive  along with a large attendant bureaucracy  whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense  Moreover  the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the EU s political elite  Both the EC and the European Court of Justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member governments  This is a step backward in Europe s political development   European criticism of America is on the rise  and the European list of complaints about America is a long and growing one  They dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation  They hate the fact that our citizens own guns  They despise the fact that we execute murderers  They resent the fact that our economy is so large  and that Americans consume so much  They also resent and fear   the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere in the world   On August 9  2002  Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK s Independent newspaper  in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be restrained  perhaps by a European military invasion  followed by a decade or so of occupation  Fortunately  the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way European progressives view the US  but rather because the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of the US literally fantastic   At least  for now   Despite the tongue in cheek nature of this editorial  however  the fact remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European intellectual and political elite   The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states  Because they have built such a system in Europe  they feel it s valid for the rest of the world  America  however  is the biggest obstacle to such a system  The Europeans cannot understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited  consensual  and constitutional government  than it does on compliance with international  norms   They view all departures from such norms as aberrant  Because the UN member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms  they assume that  since the process is ostensibly legitimate  the results must be as well  The trouble with this idea  of course  is that it gives the views of non democratic  authoritarian states the same weight as those of free  democratic societies  It sanctifies the process  with no regard to the actual results   Thus  they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens  and similar refusals from Iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power  Our repeated references to the US Constitution  and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms  are incomprehensible to them  They assume  therefore  that our refusal is based on arrogance  rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights   None of this bodes well for the future of Euro American friendship  or cooperation  If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism  their criticism of the US will rise  while their tolerance of our differences will fall  Obviously  in such a political atmosphere  the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase   That thought is frightening enough  Even more frightening  however  is the thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the new ideology of transnational progressivism                         R  A  Hettinga  mailto  rah ibuc com  The Internet Bearer Underwriting Corporation   44 Farquhar Street

      "    the historical record   by which you mean  human  historical record  is   highly overrated  nigh worthless  when you are talking about geological   timescales  even on topics with as short a timescale as climate   There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations  The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human activity starting around the industrialization of Europe  and accelerating after WWII  Most scientists studying global climate change believe that these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for increased global warming  Hence our interest in items of human time scale     It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited   during the last major ice age  they are finding substantial evidence of   humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers   paved over their civilization   The receding glaciers have turned into a   bit of an archaeological treasure chest  as they expose artifacts buried   in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the   ice for thousands of years   I don t see any compelling reason to  save   the glaciers  anyway  particularly in light of the fact that their   existence has always been transient   Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the past have often been much warmer than today  The point of global warming isn t to save the Earth    the planet is not sentient  The point is to understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on global human activity     For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are   anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another   I ll   just stick with Occam s Razor for now   The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity   It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy  This is the current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus  If the CO2 concentration goes up globally  which it has   then theory states the earth should be retaining greater solar energy  This process may be slow  and may be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide  I encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to eventual increases in global energy content  part of which will be evident as heat     Jim  \n",

      " URL   Date  Not supplied  I received some feedback in email  from several of you actually  regarding my earlier blog about the Parents Television Council  which recently published a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for children  Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much   Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12  and a game like GTA3 is as well  The PTC  however  has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games  There is a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8 9pm  the first hour of primetime  must be designated a family hour  and that no offensive shows should air during that time  I don t believe that it s the networks  responsibility to restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television  The shows that air during primetime run the gamut  some are family oriented and some aren t  There is  however  no shortage of suitable content should parents and children wish to watch TV together during this hour   It should be the parent s responsibility to police a child s television viewing  If you don t want your kids watching  Buffy the Vampire Slayer   then don t let them  but don t campaign to have the show removed from the air or shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because you don t like its content  If you don t think a show is appropriate  don t let your kids watch it   The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family oriented  An example of one such show is  Malcolm in the Middle   I would hardly call this show inappropriate for kids  Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their ultra conservative agenda  Even then  I wouldn t really mind  but the idea that all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous      \n",

      " The Electronic Telegraph  Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected By Bruce Johnston in Rome  Filed  28 08 2002    Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio  Siena s traditional bareback horse race  for the first time yesterday  arresting six people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team    Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena Giuseppe Pes  a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio nine times in 38 runs  was closely associated with the Istrice  or Porcupine  contrada   section of town   until the race earlier this month   Istrice did not have a horse in the contest   only 10 of the 17 contradas take part in each Palio   but  despite promises to the contrary  moments before the off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa  or She Wolf   Lupa are Istrice s historic rivals  and the defection was not taken well  Lupa did not win  victory going instead to Tartuca  tortoise   As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations  Mr Pes was pulled from his mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes   Mr Pes  39  whose jacket with his contrada s colours was torn from his back  was sent to hospital with fractures  cuts and bruises   Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten  Police yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers from video footage   Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada   known as contradaioli   had been arrested for beating up a jockey  despite the fact that such episodes belong to the race s ancient traditions   The Palio  which was first raced in the 14th century  is held twice a year on the cobbles of Siena s main square  For weeks beforehand supporters parade through the city  singing  waving flags and wearing their contrada colours  But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates   The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary undercurrent of intrigue and even violence  Jockeys may swap sides at the last minute  take bribes  and whip rivals  horses  and more  so long as they do not grab their reins   The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages  when the neighbourhoods  boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend Siena s fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states   The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2  to commemorate the miracles of the Madonna of Provenzano  and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin                             Yahoo  Groups Sponsor                           4 DVDs Free  s p Join Now                                                                            To unsubscribe from this group  send an email to  forteana unsubscribe egroups com    Your use of Yahoo  Groups is subject to    \n",

in comfort and plenty  while half of the human     race lives on less than  2 a day  is neither just nor stable      Absolutely correct  Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about   life on Earth today      The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy   that bears close reading  It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in   an imperfect world         The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations  It does      however  reveal the clash inside a civilization  a battle for the     future of the Muslim world  This is a struggle of ideas and this is an     area where America must excel      I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa    our new music and news channel for 15 30 year old Arabs  It s  1 in   practically every market it s entered  nearing 90  listenership in   Amman  And it s even beginning to be trusted for news  well past BBC and   taking share from every other government broadcaster      It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long term   as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term      Many of you may disagree  but I found the document below surprisingly   centrist  If you know the code  you can hear clearly partisan tones  re    ICC  Taiwan Relations Act  etc  But  still  this is as much a Democratic   platform as not  Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared   they might      As you read  replace  United States  with  Roman Empire  and it may make   as much sense  in the long view of history  I don t know how proud to be   about that  but it is telling  Sometime I daydream that the President   might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to   our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700  military installations   overseas and what they do for us  It would be a powerful education on   how engaged we are in the world around us      Heck  I d love to see a real time map of Federal expenditures around the   globe  a softly glowing necklace of embassies  carriers  arctic research   stations  hotels  golf courses  warehouses  libraries  clinics and all   the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy      Of course  this still doesn t leave me any more comfortable with the   real news in this document  the Bush Doctrine for pre emptive strikes    I d sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit   such a principle to be loosed upon the world      Rohit                                                             September 20  2002     Full Text  Bush s National Security Strategy     Following is the full text of President Bush s new national security   strategy  The document  entitled  The National Security Strategy of the   United States   will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of   the Administration s policy      INTRODUCTION     THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and   totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of   freedom    and a single sustainable model for national success  freedom    democracy  and free enterprise  In the twenty first century  only   nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and   guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the   potential of their people and assure their future prosperity  People   everywhere want to say what they think  choose who will govern them    worship as they please  educate their children    male and female  own   property  and enjoy the benefits of their labor  These values of freedom   are right and true for every person  in every society    and the duty of   protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of   freedom loving people across the globe and across the ages      Today  the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military   strength and great economic and political influence  In keeping with our   heritage and principles  we do not use our strength to press for   unilateral advantage  We seek instead to create a balance of power that   favors human freedom  conditions in which all nations and all societies   can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and   economic liberty  By making the world safer  we allow the people of the   world to make their own lives better  We will defend this just peace   against threats from terrorists and tyrants  We will preserve the peace   by building good relations among the great powers  We will extend the   peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent      Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental   commitment of the Federal Government  Today  that task has changed   dramatically  Enemies in the past needed great armies and great   industrial capabilities to endanger America  Now  shadowy networks of   individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less   than it costs to purchase a single tank  Terrorists are organized to   penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies   against us      To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal      from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and   cutting off terrorist financing  The war against terrorists of global   reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration  America will help   nations that need our assistance in combating terror  And America will   hold to account nations that are compromised by terror    because the   allies of terror are the enemies of civilization  The United States and   countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop   new home bases  Together  we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every   turn      The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism   and technology  Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking   weapons of mass destruction  and evidence indicates that they are doing   so with determination  The United States will not allow these efforts to   succeed  We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other   means of delivery  We will cooperate with other nations to deny    contain  and curtail our enemies  efforts to acquire dangerous   technologies  And  as a matter of common sense and self defense  America   will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed  We   cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best  So we must   be prepared to defeat our enemies  plans  using the best intelligence   and proceeding with deliberation  History will judge harshly those who   saw this coming danger but failed to act  In the new world we have   entered  the only path to safety is the path of action      As we defend the peace  we will also take advantage of an historic   opportunity to preserve the peace  Today  the international community   has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the   seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace   instead of continually prepare for war  Today  the world s great powers   find ourselves on the same side    united by common dangers of terrorist   violence and chaos  The United States will build on these common   interests to promote global security  We are also increasingly united by   common values  Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition  reaching   for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror  Chinese   leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of   national wealth  In time  they will find that social and political   freedom is the only source of national greatness  America will encourage   the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations    because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and   international order  We will strongly resist aggression from other great   powers    even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity    trade  and cultural advancement      Finally  the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend   the benefits of freedom across the globe  We will actively work to bring   the hope of democracy  development  free markets  and free trade to   every corner of the world  The events of September 11  2001  taught us   that weak states  like Afghanistan  can pose as great a danger to our   national interests as strong states  Poverty does not make poor people   into terrorists and murderers  Yet poverty  weak institutions  and   corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and   drug cartels within their borders      The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a   better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people  Free   trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies   out of poverty    so the United States will work with individual   nations  entire regions  and the entire global trading community to   build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity    The United States will deliver greater development assistance through   the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly    invest in their people  and encourage economic freedom  We will also   continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of   AIDS and other infectious diseases      In building a balance of power that favors freedom  the United States is   guided by the conviction that all nations have important   responsibilities  Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror    Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the   spread of weapons of mass destruction  Nations that seek international   aid must govern themselves wisely  so that aid is well spent  For   freedom to thrive  accountability must be expected and required      We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer    better world alone  Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply   the strength of freedom loving nations  The United States is committed   to lasting institutions like the United Nations  the World Trade   Organization  the Organization of American States  and NATO as well as   other long standing alliances  Coalitions of the willing can augment   these permanent institutions  In all cases  international obligations   are to be taken seriously  They are not to be undertaken symbolically to   rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment      Freedom is the non negotiable demand of human dignity  the birthright of   every person    in every civilization  Throughout history  freedom has   been threatened by war and terror  it has been challenged by the   clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants  and   it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease  Today  humanity   holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom s triumph over all   these foes  The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in   this great mission      I  Overview of America s International Strategy        Our Nation s cause has always been larger than our Nation s defense  We   fight  as we always fight  for a just peace    a peace that favors   liberty  We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists   and tyrants  We will preserve the peace by building good relations among   the great powers  And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and   open societies on every continent                 President Bush   West Point  New York   June 1  2002         The United States possesses unprecedented    and unequaled    strength   and influence in the world  Sustained by faith in the principles of   liberty  and the value of a free society  this position comes with   unparalleled responsibilities  obligations  and opportunity  The great   strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that   favors freedom      For most of the twentieth century  the world was divided by a great   struggle over ideas  destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and   equality      That great struggle is over  The militant visions of class  nation  and   race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and   discredited  America is now threatened less by conquering states than we   are by failing ones  We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by   catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few  We must   defeat these threats to our Nation  allies  and friends      This is also a time of opportunity for America  We will work to   translate this moment of influence into decades of peace  prosperity    and liberty  The U S  national security strategy will be based on a   distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our   values and our national interests  The aim of this strategy is to help   make the world not just safer but better  Our goals on the path to   progress are clear  political and economic freedom  peaceful relations   with other states  and respect for human dignity      And this path is not America s alone  It is open to all      To achieve these goals  the United States will        champion aspirations for human dignity        strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent   attacks against us and our friends        work with others to defuse regional conflicts        prevent our enemies from threatening us  our allies  and our   friends  with weapons of mass destruction        ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and   free trade        expand the circle of development by opening societies and building   the infrastructure of democracy        develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of   global power  and       transform America s national security institutions to meet the   challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century        II  Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity        Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the   language of right and wrong  I disagree  Different circumstances require   different methods  but not different moralities               President Bush   West Point  New York   June 1  2002         In pursuit of our goals  our first imperative is to clarify what we   stand for  the United States must defend liberty and justice because   these principles are right and true for all people everywhere  No nation   owns these aspirations  and no nation is exempt from them  Fathers and   mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live   free from poverty and violence  No people on earth yearn to be   oppressed  aspire to servitude  or eagerly await the midnight knock of   the secret police      America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human   dignity  the rule of law  limits on the absolute power of the state    free speech  freedom of worship  equal justice  respect for women    religious and ethnic tolerance  and respect for private property      These demands can be met in many ways  America s constitution has served   us well  Many other nations  with different histories and cultures    facing different circumstances  have successfully incorporated these   core principles into their own systems of governance  History has not   been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and   aspirations of their people      Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals  But even in   our worst moments  the principles enshrined in the Declaration of   Independence were there to guide us  As a result  America is not just a   stronger  but is a freer and more just society      Today  these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty  And   when openings arrive  we can encourage change    as we did in central   and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991  or in Belgrade in 2000  When   we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in   the Republic of Korea  and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin   America and Africa  we see examples of how authoritarian systems can   evolve  marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all   cherish      Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today    the national security strategy of the United States must start from   these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty      Our principles will guide our government s decisions about international   cooperation  the character of our foreign assistance  and the allocation   of resources  They will guide our actions and our words in international   bodies      We will        speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of   human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to   advance freedom        use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who   struggle non violently for it  ensuring that nations moving toward   democracy are rewarded for the steps they take        make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key   themes in our bilateral relations  seeking solidarity and cooperation   from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights   to move toward a better future  and       take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience   and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments        We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist   it      III  Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent   Attacks Against Us and Our Friends        Just three days removed from these events  Americans do not yet have   the distance of history  But our responsibility to history is already   clear  to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil  War has been   waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder  This nation is   peaceful  but fierce when stirred to anger  The conflict was begun on   the timing and terms of others  It will end in a way  and at an hour  of   our choosing               President Bush   Washington  D C   The National Cathedral    September 14  2001         The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of   global reach  The enemy is not a single political regime or person or   religion or ideology  The enemy is terrorism    premeditated    politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents      In many regions  legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a   lasting peace  Such grievances deserve to be  and must be  addressed   within a political process  But no cause justifies terror  The United   States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals   with them  We make no distinction between terrorists and those who   knowingly harbor or provide aid to them      The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in   our history  It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly   elusive enemy over an extended period of time  Progress will come   through the persistent accumulation of successes    some seen  some   unseen      Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can    and will  do against regimes that harbor  support  and use terrorism to   achieve their political goals  Afghanistan has been liberated  coalition   forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al Qaida  But it is not   only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists  Thousands of   trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America  South   America  Europe  Africa  the Middle East  and across Asia      Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist   organizations of global reach and attack their leadership  command    control  and communications  material support  and finances  This will   have a disabling effect upon the terrorists  ability to plan and operate      We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a   coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists  Once the regional   campaign localizes the threat to a particular state  we will help ensure   the state has the military  law enforcement  political  and financial   tools necessary to finish the task      The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the   financing of terrorism  We will identify and block the sources of   funding for terrorism  freeze the assets of terrorists and those who   support them  deny terrorists access to the international financial   system  protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists    and prevent the movement of terrorists  assets through alternative   financial networks      However  this campaign need not be sequential to be effective  the   cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we   seek      We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by        direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and   international power  Our immediate focus will be those terrorist   organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of   terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction    WMD  or their precursors        defending the United States  the American people  and our interests   at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it   reaches our borders  While the United States will constantly strive to   enlist the support of the international community  we will not hesitate   to act alone  if necessary  to exercise our right of self defense by   acting preemptively against such terrorists  to prevent them from doing   harm against our people and our country  and       denying further sponsorship  support  and sanctuary to terrorists   by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign   responsibilities        We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international   terrorism  This includes        using the full influence of the United States  and working closely   with allies and friends  to make clear that all acts of terrorism are   illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as   slavery  piracy  or genocide  behavior that no respectable government   can condone or support and all must oppose        supporting moderate and modern government  especially in the Muslim   world  to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote   terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation        diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by   enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources   on areas most at risk  and       using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of   information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of   those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism        While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also   strengthening America s homeland security to protect against and deter   attack      This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization   since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council   and the Department of Defense  Centered on a new Department of Homeland   Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental   reordering of the FBI  our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland   encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public   and the private sector      This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity  For example    emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with   terrorism but with all hazards  Our medical system will be strengthened   to manage not just bioterror  but all infectious diseases and   mass casualty dangers  Our border controls will not just stop   terrorists  but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic      While our focus is protecting America  we know that to defeat terrorism   in today s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends    Wherever possible  the United States will rely on regional organizations   and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism  Where   governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities  we   will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and   our allies can provide      As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan  we will continue to work   with international organizations such as the United Nations  as well as   non governmental organizations  and other countries to provide the   humanitarian  political  economic  and security assistance necessary to   rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people    threaten its neighbors  and provide a haven for terrorists     In the war against global terrorism  we will never forget that we are   ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life  Freedom   and fear are at war  and there will be no quick or easy end to this   conflict  In leading the campaign against terrorism  we are forging new    productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in   ways that meet the challenges of the twenty first century      IV  Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts        We build a world of justice  or we will live in a world of coercion    The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements   look so small               President Bush   Berlin  Germany   May 23  2002         Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional   disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering  In   an increasingly interconnected world  regional crisis can strain our   alliances  rekindle rivalries among the major powers  and create   horrifying affronts to human dignity  When violence erupts and states   falter  the United States will work with friends and partners to   alleviate suffering and restore stability      No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U S  action      direct or indirect    is warranted  We have finite political  economic    and military resources to meet our global priorities  The United States   will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind        The United States should invest time and resources into building   international relationships and institutions that can help manage local   crises when they emerge        The United States should be realistic about its ability to help   those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves  Where and when   people are ready to do their part  we will be willing to move decisively        Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will   apply these principles      The Israeli Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of   human suffering  because of America s close relationship with the state   of Israel and key Arab states  and because of that region s importance   to other global priorities of the United States  There can be no peace   for either side without freedom for both sides  America stands committed   to an independent and democratic Palestine  living beside Israel in   peace and security  Like all other people  Palestinians deserve a   government that serves their interests  and listens to their voices  and   counts their votes  The United States will continue to encourage all   parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and   comprehensive settlement to the conflict      The United States  the international donor community  and the World Bank   stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic   development  increased humanitarian assistance and a program to   establish  finance  and monitor a truly independent judiciary  If   Palestinians embrace democracy  and the rule of law  confront   corruption  and firmly reject terror  they can count on American support   for the creation of a Palestinian state      Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine    Permanent occupation threatens Israel s identity and democracy  So the   United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete   steps to support the emergence of a viable  credible Palestinian state    As there is progress towards security  Israel forces need to withdraw   fully to positions they held prior to September 28  2000  And consistent   with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee  Israeli settlement   activity in the occupied territories must stop  As violence subsides    freedom of movement should be restored  permitting innocent Palestinians   to resume work and normal life  The United States can play a crucial   role but  ultimately  lasting peace can only come when Israelis and   Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them      In South Asia  the United States has also emphasized the need for India   and Pakistan to resolve their disputes  This administration invested   time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and   Pakistan  These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a   constructive role when tensions in the region became acute  With   Pakistan  our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan s   choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more   open and tolerant society  The Administration sees India s potential to   become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty first century   and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly  Our   involvement in this regional dispute  building on earlier investments in   bilateral relations  looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan   that can help defuse military confrontation      Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and   respect for the rule of law  By tolerating ethnic minorities  respecting   the rule of law  and accepting open markets  Indonesia may be able to   employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its   neighbors out of poverty and desperation  It is the initiative by   Indonesia that allows U S  assistance to make a difference      In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with   countries that share our priorities  particularly Mexico  Brazil    Canada  Chile  and Colombia  Together we will promote a truly democratic   hemisphere where our integration advances security  prosperity    opportunity  and hope  We will work with regional institutions  such as   the Summit of the Americas process  the Organization of American States    OAS   and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of   the entire hemisphere      Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict  especially arising   from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices  This conflict   and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and   security of the United States  Therefore we have developed an active   strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies  enforce   their laws  defeat terrorist organizations  and cut off the supply of   drugs  while    as important    we work to reduce the demand for drugs   in our own country      In Colombia  we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist   groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking   activities that help finance the operations of such groups  We are   working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat   illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective   sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic   security to the Colombian people      In Africa  promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease  war    and desperate poverty  This threatens both a core value of the United   States    preserving human dignity    and our strategic priority      combating global terror  American interests and American principles    therefore  lead in the same direction  we will work with others for an   African continent that lives in liberty  peace  and growing prosperity    Together with our European allies  we must help strengthen Africa s   fragile states  help build indigenous capability to secure porous   borders  and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence   infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists      An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars   spread beyond borders to create regional war zones  Forming coalitions   of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to   confronting these emerging transnational threats      Africa s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that   focuses bilateral engagement  and builds coalitions of the willing  This   administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the   region        countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South   Africa  Nigeria  Kenya  and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement   and require focused attention        coordination with European allies and international institutions is   essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace   operations  and       Africa s capable reforming states and sub regional organizations   must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational   threats on a sustained basis        Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the   surest route to progress in sub Saharan Africa  where most wars are   conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically   waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference  The transition to   the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a   common responsibility for democratic political systems offers   opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent      V  Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us  Our Allies  and Our Friends   with Weapons of Mass Destruction        The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and   technology  When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear   weapons  along with ballistic missile technology    when that occurs    even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to   strike great nations  Our enemies have declared this very intention  and   have been caught seeking these terrible weapons  They want the   capability to blackmail us  or to harm us  or to harm our friends    and   we will oppose them with all our power               President Bush   West Point  New York   June 1  2002         The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States    with our   allies and friends    to emphasize deterrence of the enemy s use of   force  producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction  With the   collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War  our security   environment has undergone profound transformation      Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our   relationship with Russia  the dividends are evident  an end to the   balance of terror that divided us  an historic reduction in the nuclear   arsenals on both sides  and cooperation in areas such as   counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were   inconceivable      But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists    None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power   that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union  However  the nature and   motivations of these new adversaries  their determination to obtain   destructive powers hitherto available only to the world s strongest   states  and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass   destruction against us  make today s security environment more complex   and dangerous      In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue   states that  while different in important ways  share a number of   attributes  These states        brutalize their own people and squander their national resources   for the personal gain of the rulers        display no regard for international law  threaten their neighbors    and callously violate international treaties to which they are party        are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction  along with   other advanced military technology  to be used as threats or offensively   to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes        sponsor terrorism around the globe  and       reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything   for which it stands        At the time of the Gulf War  we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq s   designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against   Iran and its own people  but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear   weapons and biological agents  In the past decade North Korea has become   the world s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles  and has tested   increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal    Other rogue regimes seek nuclear  biological  and chemical weapons as   well  These states  pursuit of  and global trade in  such weapons has   become a looming threat to all nations      We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients   before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction   against the United States and our allies and friends  Our response must   take full advantage of strengthened alliances  the establishment of new   partnerships with former adversaries  innovation in the use of military   forces  modern technologies  including the development of an effective   missile defense system  and increased emphasis on intelligence   collection and analysis      Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes        Proactive counterproliferation efforts  We must deter and defend   against the threat before it is unleashed  We must ensure that key   capabilities    detection  active and passive defenses  and counterforce   capabilities    are integrated into our defense transformation and our   homeland security systems  Counterproliferation must also be integrated   into the doctrine  training  and equipping of our forces and those of   our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD armed   adversaries        Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and   terrorists from acquiring the materials  technologies and expertise   necessary for weapons of mass destruction  We will enhance diplomacy    arms control  multilateral export controls  and threat reduction   assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD  and when   necessary  interdict enabling technologies and materials  We will   continue to build coalitions to support these efforts  encouraging their   increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and   threat reduction programs  The recent G 8 agreement to commit up to  20   billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step   forward        Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD   use  whether by terrorists or hostile states  Minimizing the effects of   WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such   weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading   enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends  The United States   must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our   forces abroad  and to help friends and allies if they are attacked        It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of   this new threat  Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists  the   United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have   in the past  The inability to deter a potential attacker  the immediacy   of today s threats  and the magnitude of potential harm that could be   caused by our adversaries  choice of weapons  do not permit that option    We cannot let our enemies strike first        In the Cold War  especially following the Cuban missile crisis  we   faced a generally status quo  risk averse adversary  Deterrence was an   effective defense  But deterrence based only upon the threat of   retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states   more willing to take risks  gambling with the lives of their people  and   the wealth of their nations        In the Cold War  weapons of mass destruction were considered   weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who   used them  Today  our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons   of choice  For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and   military aggression against their neighbors  These weapons may also   allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our   allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior   of rogue states  Such states also see these weapons as their best means   of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States        Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a   terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the   targeting of innocents  whose so called soldiers seek martyrdom in death   and whose most potent protection is statelessness  The overlap between   states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to   action        For centuries  international law recognized that nations need not suffer   an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves   against forces that present an imminent danger of attack  Legal scholars   and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption   on the existence of an imminent threat    most often a visible   mobilization of armies  navies  and air forces preparing to attack      We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and   objectives of today s adversaries  Rogue states and terrorists do not   seek to attack us using conventional means  They know such attacks would   fail  Instead  they rely on acts of terrorism and  potentially  the use   of weapons of mass destruction    weapons that can be easily concealed   and delivered covertly and without warning      The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian   population  in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law   of warfare  As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11  2001    mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and   these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired   and used weapons of mass destruction      The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions   to counter a sufficient threat to our national security  The greater the   threat  the greater is the risk of inaction    and the more compelling   the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves  even if   uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy s attack  To   forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries  the United   States will  if necessary  act preemptively      The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging   threats  nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression    Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek   the world s most destructive technologies  the United States cannot   remain idle while dangers gather      We will always proceed deliberately  weighing the consequences of our   actions  To support preemptive options  we will        build better  more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide   timely  accurate information on threats  wherever they may emerge        coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the   most dangerous threats  and       continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to   conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results        The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat   to the United States or our allies and friends  The reasons for our   actions will be clear  the force measured  and the cause just      VI  Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and   Free Trade         When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a   privileged few  no amount    no amount    of development aid is ever   enough  When nations respect their people  open markets  invest in   better health and education  every dollar of aid  every dollar of trade   revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively               President Bush   Monterrey  Mexico   March 22  2002         A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing   prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world  Economic growth   supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher   incomes  It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty  spurs   economic and legal reform  and the fight against corruption  and it   reinforces the habits of liberty      We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America s   shores  All governments are responsible for creating their own economic   policies and responding to their own economic challenge  We will use our   economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of   policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic   growth  including        pro growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business   investment  innovation  and entrepreneurial activity        tax policies    particularly lower marginal tax rates    that   improve incentives for work and investment        rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are   confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic   endeavors        strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most   efficient use        sound fiscal policies to support business activity        investments in health and education that improve the well being and   skills of the labor force and population as a whole  and       free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the   diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and   opportunity        The lessons of history are clear  market economies  not   command and control economies with the heavy hand of government  are the   best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty  Policies that further   strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for   all economies    industrialized countries  emerging markets  and the   developing world      A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U S    national security interests  We want our allies to have strong economies   for their own sake  for the sake of the global economy  and for the sake   of global security  European efforts to remove structural barriers in   their economies are particularly important in this regard  as are   Japan s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of   non performing loans in the Japanese banking system  We will continue to   use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners      including through the Group of Seven  G 7     to discuss policies they   are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher   global economic growth      Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic   growth  International flows of investment capital are needed to expand   the productive potential of these economies  These flows allow emerging   markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise   living standards and reduce poverty  Our long term objective should be a   world in which all countries have investment grade credit ratings that   allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in   their future      We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve   access to larger capital flows at lower cost  To this end  we will   continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial   markets  We will work actively with other countries  the International   Monetary Fund  IMF   and the private sector to implement the G 7 Action   Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and   more effectively resolving them when they occur      The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from   occurring  and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing   so  We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy   conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on   achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy    exchange rate policy  and financial sector policy      The concept of  free trade  arose as a moral principle even before it   became a pillar of economics  If you can make something that others   value  you should be able to sell it to them  If others make something   that you value  you should be able to buy it  This is real freedom  the   freedom for a person    or a nation    to make a living  To promote free   trade  the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy        Seize the global initiative  The new global trade negotiations we   helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda    especially in agriculture  manufacturing  and services  targeted for   completion in 2005  The United States has led the way in completing the   accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade   Organization  We will assist Russia s preparations to join the WTO        Press regional initiatives  The United States and other democracies   in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of   the Americas  targeted for completion in 2005  This year the United   States will advocate market access negotiations with its partners    targeted on agriculture  industrial goods  services  investment  and   government procurement  We will also offer more opportunity to the   poorest continent  Africa  starting with full use of the preferences   allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act  and leading to free   trade        Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements  Building on the   free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001  the Administration   will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and   Singapore  Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of   developed and developing countries in all regions of the world    Initially  Central America  Southern Africa  Morocco  and Australia will   be our principal focal points        Renew the executive congressional partnership  Every   administration s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with   Congress  After a gap of 8 years  the Administration reestablished   majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing   Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for   developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002  This Administration will   work with Congress to enact new bilateral  regional  and global trade   agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade   Promotion Authority        Promote the connection between trade and development  Trade   policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights    competition  the rule of law  investment  the spread of knowledge  open   societies  the efficient allocation of resources  and regional   integration    all leading to growth  opportunity  and confidence in   developing countries  The United States is implementing The Africa   Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market access for nearly all goods   produced in the 35 countries of sub Saharan Africa  We will make more   use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue   to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer   countries take advantage of these opportunities  Beyond market access    the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public   health  We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are   flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical   medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV AIDS  tuberculosis  and   malaria        Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices    Commerce depends on the rule of law  international trade depends on   enforceable agreements  Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing   disputes with the European Union  Canada  and Mexico and to make a   global effort to address new technology  science  and health regulations   that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture  Laws   against unfair trade practices are often abused  but the international   community must be able to address genuine concerns about government   subsidies and dumping  International industrial espionage which   undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred        Help domestic industries and workers adjust  There is a sound   statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used   in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the   American steel industry  The benefits of free trade depend upon the   enforcement of fair trading practices  These safeguards help ensure that   the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American   workers  Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the   change and dynamism of open markets        Protect the environment and workers  The United States must foster   economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with   widening prosperity  We will incorporate labor and environmental   concerns into U S  trade negotiations  creating a healthy  network    between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO  and use the   International Labor Organization  trade preference programs  and trade   talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade        Enhance energy security  We will strengthen our own energy security   and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our   allies  trading partners  and energy producers to expand the sources and   types of global energy supplied  especially in the Western Hemisphere    Africa  Central Asia  and the Caspian region  We will also continue to   work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient   technologies        Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize   greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth  containing   them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the   global climate  Our overall objective is to reduce America s greenhouse   gas emissions relative to the size of our economy  cutting such   emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10   years  by the year 2012  Our strategies for attaining this goal will be   to        remain committed to the basic U N  Framework Convention for   international cooperation        obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of   the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to   companies that can show real cuts        develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission   reductions        promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology  as   well as nuclear power    which produces no greenhouse gas emissions    while also improving fuel economy for U S  cars and trucks        increase spending on research and new conservation technologies  to   a total of  4 5 billion    the largest sum being spent on climate change   by any country in the world and a  700 million increase over last year s   budget  and       assist developing countries  especially the major greenhouse gas   emitters such as China and India  so that they will have the tools and   resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and   better path        VII  Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building   the Infrastructure of Democracy        In World War II we fought to make the world safer  then worked to   rebuild it  As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror  we   must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens               President Bush   Washington  D C   Inter American   Development Bank    March 14  2002         A world where some live in comfort and plenty  while half of the human   race lives on less than  2 a day  is neither just nor stable  Including   all of the world s poor in an expanding circle of development    and   opportunity    is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of   U S  international policy      Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic   growth in the poorest countries  Worse  development aid has often served   to prop up failed policies  relieving the pressure for reform and   perpetuating misery  Results of aid are typically measured in dollars   spent by donors  not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction   achieved by recipients  These are the indicators of a failed strategy      Working with other nations  the United States is confronting this   failure  We forged a new consensus at the U N  Conference on Financing   for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance    and   the strategies to achieve those objectives    must change      This Administration s goal is to help unleash the productive potential   of individuals in all nations  Sustained growth and poverty reduction is   impossible without the right national policies  Where governments have   implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels   of assistance  The United States and other developed countries should   set an ambitious and specific target  to double the size of the world s   poorest economies within a decade      The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to   achieve this goal        Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of   national reform  We propose a 50 percent increase in the core   development assistance given by the United States  While continuing our   present programs  including humanitarian assistance based on need alone    these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge   Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly  invest   in their people  and encourage economic freedom  Governments must fight   corruption  respect basic human rights  embrace the rule of law  invest   in health care and education  follow responsible economic policies  and   enable entrepreneurship  The Millennium Challenge Account will reward   countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those   that have not to implement reforms        Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development   banks in raising living standards  The United States is committed to a   comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other   multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of   the world s poor  We have reversed the downward trend in U S    contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U S    contributions to the International Development Association  IDA     the   World Bank s fund for the poorest countries    and the African   Development Fund  The key to raising living standards and reducing   poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth  especially   in the poorest countries  We will continue to press the multilateral   development banks to focus on activities that increase economic   productivity  such as improvements in education  health  rule of law    and private sector development  Every project  every loan  every grant   must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in   developing countries        Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development   assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world s   poor  When it comes to economic development  what really matters is that   more children are getting a better education  more people have access to   health care and clean water  or more workers can find jobs to make a   better future for their families  We have a moral obligation to measure   the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering   results  For this reason  we will continue to demand that our own   development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral   development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for   achieving those goals  Thanks to U S  leadership  the recent IDA   replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation   system that measures recipient countries  progress  For the first time    donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the   achievement of actual development results  and part of the U S    contribution is linked in this way  We will strive to make sure that the   World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this   progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything   that these institutions do        Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in   the form of grants instead of loans  Greater use of results based grants   is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments    particularly in the social sectors  without saddling them with   ever larger debt burdens  As a result of U S  leadership  the recent IDA   agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the   poorest countries for education  HIV AIDS  health  nutrition  water    sanitation  and other human needs  Our goal is to build on that progress   by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development   banks  We will also challenge universities  nonprofits  and the private   sector to match government efforts by using grants to support   development projects that show results        Open societies to commerce and investment  Trade and investment are   the real engines of economic growth  Even if government aid increases    most money for development must come from trade  domestic capital  and   foreign investment  An effective strategy must try to expand these flows   as well  Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national   security strategy        Secure public health  The scale of the public health crisis in poor   countries is enormous  In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics   like HIV AIDS  malaria  and tuberculosis  growth and development will be   threatened until these scourges can be contained  Resources from the   developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest   governance  which supports prevention programs and provides effective   local infrastructure  The United States has strongly backed the new   global fund for HIV AIDS organized by U N  Secretary General Kofi Annan   and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for   treatment and care  The United States already contributes more than   twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor  If the   global fund demonstrates its promise  we will be ready to give even more        Emphasize education  Literacy and learning are the foundation of   democracy and development  Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources   are devoted to education  This proportion should grow  The United States   will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20   percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher   training in Africa  The United States can also bring information   technology to these societies  many of whose education systems have been   devastated by AIDS        Continue to aid agricultural development  New technologies    including biotechnology  have enormous potential to improve crop yields   in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water    Using sound science  the United States should help bring these benefits   to the 800 million people  including 300 million children  who still   suffer from hunger and malnutrition        VIII  Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers   of Global Power        We have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the 17th   century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead   of prepare for war               President Bush   West Point  New York   June 1  2002         America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions    as   broad as practicable    of states able and willing to promote a balance   of power that favors freedom  Effective coalition leadership requires   clear priorities  an appreciation of others  interests  and consistent   consultations among partners with a spirit of humility      There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can   accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies   and friends in Canada and Europe  Europe is also the seat of two of the   strongest and most able international institutions in the world  the   North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   which has  since its   inception  been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter European   security  and the European Union  EU   our partner in opening world   trade      The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO  as NATO itself   recognized when it invoked its Article V self defense clause for the   first time  NATO s core mission    collective defense of the   transatlantic alliance of democracies    remains  but NATO must develop   new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new   circumstances  NATO must build a capability to field  at short notice    highly mobile  specially trained forces whenever they are needed to   respond to a threat against any member of the alliance      The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened    creating coalitions under NATO s own mandate  as well as contributing to   mission based coalitions  To achieve this  we must        expand NATO s membership to those democratic nations willing and   able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests        ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate   combat contributions to make in coalition warfare        develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become   effective multinational fighting forces        take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of   scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that   they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities        streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to   meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of   training  integrating  and experimenting with new force configurations    and       maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as   we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces        If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes  the rewards will be a   partnership as central to the security and interests of its member   states as was the case during the Cold War  We will sustain a common   perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to   take common action in defense of our nations and their interests  At the   same time  we welcome our European allies  efforts to forge a greater   foreign policy and defense identity with the EU  and commit ourselves to   close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO  We   cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of   transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come      The attacks of September 11 energized America s Asian alliances    Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an   attack on Australia itself  following that historic decision with the   dispatch of some of the world s finest combat forces for Operation   Enduring Freedom  Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented   levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist   attack  We have deepened cooperation on counter terrorism with our   alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received   invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand      The war against terrorism has proven that America s alliances in Asia   not only underpin regional peace and stability  but are flexible and   ready to deal with new challenges  To enhance our Asian alliances and   friendships  we will          look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and   global affairs based on our common interests  our common values  and our   close defense and diplomatic cooperation        work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while   preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of   the region over the longer term        build on 50 years of U S  Australian alliance cooperation as we   continue working together to resolve regional and global problems    as   we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora        maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our   allies  our requirements  our technological advances  and the strategic   environment  and       build on stability provided by these alliances  as well as with   institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation   forum  to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage   change in this dynamic region        We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power   competition  Several potential great powers are now in the midst of   internal transition    most importantly Russia  India  and China  In all   three cases  recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly   global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape      With Russia  we are already building a new strategic relationship based   on a central reality of the twenty first century  the United States and   Russia are no longer strategic adversaries  The Moscow Treaty on   Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a   critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive    long term relations with the Euro Atlantic community and the United   States  Russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their   country s current weakness and the policies    internal and external      needed to reverse those weaknesses  They understand  increasingly  that   Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that   Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas      United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to   refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and   challenges  We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the   global war on terrorism  We are facilitating Russia s entry into the   World Trade Organization  without lowering standards for accession  to   promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations  We have   created the NATO Russia Council with the goal of deepening security   cooperation among Russia  our European allies  and ourselves  We will   continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the   former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable   neighborhood will reinforce Russia s growing commitment to integration   into the Euro Atlantic community      At the same time  we are realistic about the differences that still   divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to   build an enduring strategic partnership  Lingering distrust of our   motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our   relations  Russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market   democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons   of mass destruction remain matters of great concern  Russia s very   weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation  Nevertheless  those   opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years    or even   decades      The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral   relationship with India based on a conviction that U S  interests   require a strong relationship with India  We are the two largest   democracies  committed to political freedom protected by representative   government  India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well  We   have a common interest in the free flow of commerce  including through   the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean  Finally  we share an interest   in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia      Differences remain  including over the development of India s nuclear   and missile programs  and the pace of India s economic reforms  But   while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about   India  today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with   which we have common strategic interests  Through a strong partnership   with India  we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic   future      The United States relationship with China is an important part of our   strategy to promote a stable  peaceful  and prosperous Asia Pacific   region  We welcome the emergence of a strong  peaceful  and prosperous   China  The democratic development of China is crucial to that future    Yet  a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst   features of the Communist legacy  China s leaders have not yet made the   next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state    In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its   neighbors in the Asia Pacific region  China is following an outdated   path that  in the end  will hamper its own pursuit of national   greatness  In time  China will find that social and political freedom is   the only source of that greatness      The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing   China  We already cooperate well where our interests overlap  including   the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean   peninsula  Likewise  we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan   and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and   similar transitional concerns  Shared health and environmental threats    such as the spread of HIV AIDS  challenge us to promote jointly the   welfare of our citizens      Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become   more open with information  promote the development of civil society    and enhance individual human rights  China has begun to take the road to   political openness  permitting many personal freedoms and conducting   village level elections  yet remains strongly committed to national   one party rule by the Communist Party  To make that nation truly   accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations  however  much work   remains to be done  Only by allowing the Chinese people to think    assemble  and worship freely can China reach its full potential      Our important trade relationship will benefit from China s entry into   the World Trade Organization  which will create more export   opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers  workers    and companies  China is our fourth largest trading partner  with over    100 billion in annual two way trade  The power of market principles and   the WTO s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance   openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic   protections for commerce and for citizens  There are  however  other   areas in which we have profound disagreements  Our commitment to the   self defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one  Human   rights is another  We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation   commitments  We will work to narrow differences where they exist  but   not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree      The events of September 11  2001  fundamentally changed the context for   relations between the United States and other main centers of global   power  and opened vast  new opportunities  With our long standing allies   in Europe and Asia  and with leaders in Russia  India  and China  we   must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships   become routine and unproductive      Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge  We   can build fruitful habits of consultation  quiet argument  sober   analysis  and common action  In the long term  these are the practices   that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open   the path of progress      IX  Transform America s National Security Institutions to Meet the   Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty First Century        Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity  They did not touch   its source  America is successful because of the hard work  creativity    and enterprise of our people               President Bush   Washington  D C   Joint Session of Congress    September 20  2001         The major institutions of American national security were designed in a   different era to meet different requirements  All of them must be   transformed      It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength    We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge  Our military s   highest priority is to defend the United States  To do so effectively    our military must        assure our allies and friends        dissuade future military competition        deter threats against U S  interests  allies  and friends  and       decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails        The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces  and their   forward presence  have maintained the peace in some of the world s most   strategically vital regions  However  the threats and enemies we must   confront have changed  and so must our forces  A military structured to   deter massive Cold War era armies must be transformed to focus more on   how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might   occur  We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational   challenges      The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound   symbols of the U S  commitments to allies and friends  Through our   willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others    the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of   power that favors freedom  To contend with uncertainty and to meet the   many security challenges we face  the United States will require bases   and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia  as   well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment   of U S  forces      Before the war in Afghanistan  that area was low on the list of major   planning contingencies  Yet  in a very short time  we had to operate   across the length and breadth of that remote nation  using every branch   of the armed forces  We must prepare for more such deployments by   developing assets such as advanced remote sensing  long range precision   strike capabilities  and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces    This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the   ability to defend the homeland  conduct information operations  ensure   U S  access to distant theaters  and protect critical U S    infrastructure and assets in outer space      Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new   approaches to warfare  strengthening joint operations  exploiting U S    intelligence advantages  and taking full advantage of science and   technology  We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is   run  especially in financial management and recruitment and retention    Finally  while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight   the war on terrorism  the goal must be to provide the President with a   wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of   coercion against the United States  our allies  and our friends      We know from history that deterrence can fail  and we know from   experience that some enemies cannot be deterred  The United States must   and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy      whether a state or non state actor    to impose its will on the United   States  our allies  or our friends  We will maintain the forces   sufficient to support our obligations  and to defend freedom  Our forces   will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a   military build up in hopes of surpassing  or equaling  the power of the   United States      Intelligence    and how we use it    is our first line of defense   against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states  Designed   around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive    fixed object    the Soviet bloc    the intelligence community is coping   with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of   targets      We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to   keep pace with the nature of these threats  Intelligence must be   appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems   and coordinated with our allies and friends  We need to protect the   capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the   knowledge of how best to surprise us  Those who would harm us also seek   the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and   to maximize injury      We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide   integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security  Since   the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted   inside the United States  we must also ensure the proper fusion of   information between intelligence and law enforcement      Initiatives in this area will include        strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence   to lead the development and actions of the Nation s foreign intelligence   capabilities        establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides   seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing   the nation and our allies        continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to   sustain our intelligence advantage        investing in future capabilities while working to protect them   through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence   capabilities  and       collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the   government with all source analysis        As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend   America s interests  it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other   nations  We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding   sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy  The State   Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with   other governments  And in this new era  its people and institutions must   be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations   and international institutions  Officials trained mainly in   international politics must also extend their reach to understand   complex issues of domestic governance around the world  including public   health  education  law enforcement  the judiciary  and public diplomacy      Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations  civil   wars  and other humanitarian catastrophes  As humanitarian relief   requirements are better understood  we must also be able to help build   police forces  court systems  and legal codes  local and provincial   government institutions  and electoral systems  Effective international   cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals  backed by American   readiness to play our part      Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out   to others  we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to   public information efforts that can help people around the world learn   about and understand America  The war on terrorism is not a clash of   civilizations  It does  however  reveal the clash inside a civilization    a battle for the future of the Muslim world  This is a struggle of ideas   and this is an area where America must excel      We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet   our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired   by the potential for investigations  inquiry  or prosecution by the   International Criminal Court  ICC   whose jurisdiction does not extend   to Americans and which we do not accept  We will work together with   other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and   cooperation  through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral   agreements that will protect U S  nationals from the ICC  We will   implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act  whose   provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U S    personnel and officials      We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the   right level and allocation of government spending on national security    The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this   war  At home  our most important priority is to protect the homeland for   the American people      Today  the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is   diminishing  In a globalized world  events beyond America s borders have   a greater impact inside them  Our society must be open to people  ideas    and goods from across the globe  The characteristics we most cherish      our freedom  our cities  our systems of movement  and modern life    are   vulnerable to terrorism  This vulnerability will persist long after we   bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks    As time passes  individuals may gain access to means of destruction that   until now could be wielded only by armies  fleets  and squadrons  This   is a new condition of life  We will adjust to it and thrive    in spite   of it      In exercising our leadership  we will respect the values  judgment  and   interests of our friends and partners  Still  we will be prepared to act   apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require  When we   disagree on particulars  we will explain forthrightly the grounds for   our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives  We will not allow   such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together  with   our allies and our friends  our shared fundamental interests and values      Ultimately  the foundation of American strength is at home  It is in the   skills of our people  the dynamism of our economy  and the resilience of   our institutions  A diverse  modern society has inherent  ambitious    entrepreneurial energy  Our strength comes from what we do with that   energy  That is where our national security begins     \n",

taint org  Sent  Monday  September 23  2002 2 44 PM Subject  How about subsidizing SSL access to Google      In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week   The Search Goes On   Sept  19th   the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of Google s service is not its card catalog  which merely points surfers in the right direction  but the entire library  By maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web  if you can get to Google s cache  you can read anything you d like   The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce these rules  however  all depend on the fact that traffic to and from Google  or indeed almost all public websites  is unencrypted  Almost all Web browsers  however  include support for Secure Sockets Layer  SSL  encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like  Upgrading to SSL makes it effectively impossible for a  man in the middle  to meddle  censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in China  The only choice left is to either ban the entire site  range of IP addresses   but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article   Of course  the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money  If the United States is so concerned about the free flow of information  why shouldn t the Broadcasting Board of Governors sponsor an encrypted interface to Google  or for that matter  the rest of the Web   To date  public diplomacy efforts have focused on public sector programming for the Voice of America  Radio Sawa  and the like  Just imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private sector media instead  Nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself    and most of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project   On second thought  I can hardly imagine this Administration  promoting  the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights  Never mind     Best  Rohit Khare                                                               The search goes on China backtracks on banning Google up to a point  Sep 19th 2002   BEIJING From The Economist print edition  IN CHINESE  the nickname for Google  an American Internet search engine  is gougou  meaning  doggy   For the country s fast growing population of Internet users  46m  according to an official estimate   it is proving an elusive creature  Earlier this month  the Chinese authorities blocked access to Google from Internet service providers in China apparently because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to forbidden sites  Now  after an outcry from those users  access has been restored   An unusual climbdown by China s zealous Internet censors  Hardly  More sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government  Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by Google as it trawls the Internet  These once provided a handy way for Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites   After the blocking of Google on August 31st  many Chinese Internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move  Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site to far less powerful search engines in China   Duncan Clark  the head of a Beijing based technology consultancy firm  BDA  China  Ltd  says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the Internet  Until recently  it had focused on blocking individual sites  including all pages stored on them  Now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content  For example earlier this week when using Eastnet  a Beijing based Internet

      " URL   Date  2002 10 07T17 59 05 05 00   Joe Gregorio   My next pet project    8220 Trying to re create the  Good Easy  on a Windows machine   8221  I have also made half hearted attempts in this direction  as I am forced to use Windows during the day  I say half hearted because I m still application centric  and I don t go as far with keyboard shortcuts as I could  But I don t use the desktop at all  never have  on any system   and I don t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I personally find them awkward  YMMV   If you must use Windows  the first step towards a productive system is managing your Start menu   I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs   0 Control Panel    1 Mozilla    2 Emacs    3 DOS home    4 DOS work    5 DOS incoming   each of which gives me a command line  but in different directories    7 Python    9 IE   Also    Explorer home      Explorer work      Explorer incoming   which open Explorer windows in various useful directories  the same directories as the DOS shortcuts  only with the shift key held down  and yes  I intentionally set it up so that   went to my work folder   Less used programs are taken out of their useless submenus  as installed  and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed   Ad aware    Excel    IM    Netscape 4    Paint Shop Pro    Query Tool  ODBC     VMWare    Word   All other submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu   Yes  delete  Accessories   Do you honestly ever use it  If so  it s probably a sign of a larger productivity problem   Things which never need to be run manually  like WinZip and Quicktime  are removed from the Programs menu  Maintaining a clean Programs menu is an ongoing struggle  but well worth it   On most modern keyboards  there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu  which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys  Otherwise ctrl esc always works  Menu 4 gives me a new command prompt in my work directory  Menu P N runs Netscape 4  for compatibility testing in my day job  ugh   Mozilla and Emacs are almost always open  but I quit lesser used applications as soon as I m done using them  mostly because my laptop doesn t have a lot of memory    I install Cygwin so that the command line is actually useful  Cygwin is a collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities  including mv  cp  scp  ssh  man  tar  less  grep  patch  ncftp  cvs  and many others  And bash  which I don t use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames  I also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 120 x 50  almost full screen at 1024 x 768   and screen buffer size to 120 x 3000  Set window position at 0 x 0  and don t let the system position the window   In Mozilla  I set my home page to  about blank   set Internet Search to search with Google  use Tabbed Browsing  open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases  always show the tab bar  and load links in the background  essential for weblog surfing  you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background   Under Scripts   Plugins  I do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows  I turn off the sidebar  turn on the Site Navigation Bar  delete all pre installed bookmarks  and create two bookmarks  one which takes me to my webmail  and another which takes me to my internal site search  from which I can find all other bookmarks I need   In Internet Explorer  I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog  since that s the only thing I do in Internet Explorer  alt tab back and forth between Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup pgdown between tabs within Mozilla  since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs  making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible   I use Emacs locally and vi remotely  because the default behavior of Emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable   For instance  editing a CGI script named foo cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo cgi  backup file  which is world readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks  Try this sometime on your favorite web site   Among other things  my  emacs file  which is actually called  emacs on Windows  instructs Emacs to store all backup files in a single directory  d \\backup   to treat all XML files as DocBook  all CGI scripts as Python  and all SQL scripts as PL SQL  to use Cygwin s bash shell for M x shell  to use a single maximized frame with no menubar  titled as the name of the current file  to show column numbers  to accept  y  and  n  for yes no questions  not to blink  not to beep  and to close the current file when I press M w  I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad exe to get all text files to open in Emacs   I got this idea from Ultraedit   My  emacs file is my second most backed up possession   I don t use Windows  useless directory structure for user home directories  On my D drive I have d \\home  contains directories for my books and other personal projects  each under CVS control  8212 also set as my home directory using the HOME environment variable   d \\work  contains directories for each work project  also under CVS   d \\incoming  set as default download directory for all programs that download things   and d \\backup  used by Emacs  and for temporary storage  for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created CVS projects   I don t know or care what s where on my C drive   I have tried many  many address books  and still store all my contacts  email addresses  snail mail addresses  phone numbers  and other vital personal information in a text file called phone  stored in d \\home\\phone  It is not in any particular format  other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries  I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses after their name  and use M x occur in Emacs to search by keyword  This file is my single most backed up possession   Other essential free Windows utilities I use  in no particular order   TweakUI

      " URL   Date  Not supplied  I just finished reading an article about Mozilla for Salon com  This excerpt was rather amusing    It is a good question  because in almost every way  Mozilla is a better browser than Navigator  For example  Netscape s best new feature  tabbed browsing    which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser window  and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name    was in Mozilla many months ago  and the Mozilla project that created it  called MultiZilla  already has an improved version available  When asked about this  Yecies  of Netscape  said   That s true  but the engineer who s working on it  is a Netscape employee  It was always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for Netscape     Yes  ok  I suppose that s true if by  Netscape employee  you really meant  Apple employee   and by  always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for Netscape  you meant  was done in a weekend for Mozilla because I thought MultiZilla was cool    Here s how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened  One night I finally downloaded an extension called MultiZilla  go check it out on mozdev org  I was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed browsing  I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor  a tabbed browser that embedded WinIE   MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree  The first was a UI flaw  namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last context menu item  The GUI was similar enough that there would have been definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor s more obscure capabilities  like sticky names and tab locking   The second concern was that the tab behavior wasn t encapsulated cleanly into a widget   I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time  did it in a weekend  that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files would be minimal  Once I established that it didn t degrade performance in the single tab case  I checked it in as an experiment   The response was overwhelming  as were the bugs that started being filed  So much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree  I was overruled by Mozilla  which turned out to be a good thing for all I think     Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed browsing on the engineering side  and in the Mozilla community   Netscape still didn t get it  Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document  They continued to do so for months  simply not getting it  It was this odd curiosity that one of their engineers had checked in  and they didn t know what to make of it   Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board  I m sure Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking  Can t you just see it now  We ll have a Popup Manager  and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager  and twenty seven preferences for fine grained control of all aspects of popups   Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is  When their engineers say  you should do this  or  you should do that   they get completely ignored  or blown off   but when CNet says  We didn t like this  or we didn t like that    Netscape scurries to meet their demands  That is simply pathetic            \n",

  help me   is that the American public perceives the rest of the world   basically as a thread  against which you have to defend yourself using   power    This is not a correct assessment   The American public couldn t care less   However  the US intelligence community correctly perceives a threat  and it isn t the third world   Many European and other developed nations aggressively engage in covert operations against American interests   Its been going on for years and isn t even news   Things have stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased   For better or worse  the US is relatively good at that game too   As with most backwater wars  they are proxies for the interests of the big players   Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US   You ll find that half the countries on that list are European   Most people are unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years      On the other hand the Europeans are used to the peace of their cozy   post war system where external security is not an issue  All security   threads can be resolved by giving money to the threatening people   and to integrate them into the wealthy sphere  Balkan  Palestinians           Bullshit   The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition  obviously some more than others   US SpecOps are often brought in to do dirty work inside Europe for European governments  usually with government  advisors  along for the mission    I ve always wondered what the deal was such that we got involved at all   The point being that we ve acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments  and in recent years  not ancient history   I know SpecOp guys who left the military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these missions while they were posted for that duty  I m certainly glad I was never assigned missions in that theater  because there is a lot of covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies   Regardless  giving money to people that threaten you has never created meaningful peace in the history of civilization   We call it extortion under any other guise      A lot of the current EU   US issues can be explained by this difference   of perception  such as the current American unilateralism  nobody wants   to help us    the American arrogance towards Europe  they don t want to   do anything  so why should we ask them   and the growing rejection of the   American policy in Europe  they want to abolish the law      Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case   Whatever problems the US is having these days  Europe looks worse and is going downhill faster   Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the European way of doing things is beyond me   The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack for medical advice   I really don t see what is wrong with  unilateral  anyway   Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff  I hope the incessant knee jerk conformist screeching that Americans see coming from Europe doesn t actually represent the views of Europeans   For various reasons I m not exactly a cheerleader for the US government  but the premises of the argument against them here are lame      My personal point is that few Americans  percentage of overall population    have ever left their country  while even German construction workers   regularly spend their holidays in Spain  So I m not surprised that   paranoia is growing    I m betting you are underestimating the actual percentage   The vast majority of people I know have lived  worked  and traveled outside the country at one time or another   And I doubt Europeans have traveled anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have  Despite the best efforts of France  Europe is  still  not the center of the universe   I ll throw you a bone though  most Americans do consider Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it   But from the perspective of an American  how could you NOT look at it this way   The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the years   I love the smell of Euro chauvinism in the morning   First  you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and culturally homogenous   Anybody that has actually traveled throughout North America knows this isn t true  there are more than five major and very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone  never mind the hundreds of diverse regional sub populations  some of which are truly foreign   Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with having the same culture   That would be like saying Mexico is culturally identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language   A Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with your average person living in San Francisco  despite speaking the same language and nominally living in the same country   If I want to visit a wildly different culture for the holidays  I ll go to Oakland  New Orleans  or similar    they are far more different from where I live than some countries I ve traveled to   And a lot of these places are farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany   Second  the State I live in is the size of Germany   When I travel to a neighboring State  which I do regularly   how is this not equivalent  In fact  I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your German construction workers   If you look at the EU as a single country  only then does your analogy become comparable   What kind of ridiculous superiority do Europeans get from having  relatively  tiny countries   In truth  I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the US   There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very similar to the US   The only real difference is that Europeans have dozens of different languages  which is hardly something I would call an advantage   Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can t understand a word they are saying either     James Rogers jamesr best com    \n",

      " BlogStart     Dublin    something from the archives     Daev Walsh forwards an article from The Irish Digest about   Billy in the Bowl     This story is also immortalised in an old Dublin song  which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track   Billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman  where I now live  during the 18th century  who discovered a new  but not entirely legal  way to make money   BlogEnd  LinkText  Billy in the Bowl  From          daev  hellshaw fringeware com  Subject       The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler  A story of my new neighbourhood      The Irish Digest July 1964   The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler  The handsome  deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors  Then  one night  he made the biggest mistake of his life  DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things   the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes   Many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin  but there was one who campaigned among the working class   This was  Billy In The Bowl   The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy s sole means of transport was a large bowl shaped car with wheels   Seated in this   bowl    the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs  one in each hand   Billy s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary  as he had been born without legs   Nature  however  had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and  what was most important  an unusually handsome face   This was Billy s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers by from their small change   The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century Grangegorman and Stoneybatter  until a servant girl or an old lady would come along   He would then put on is most attractive smile which  together with his black curly hair  never failed to halt the females   The fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity    Billy in the Bowl   however  wasn t satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins  what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money   The more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices   gambling and drinking   As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers  The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening as dusk  was falling   The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street   on Dublin s North Quays   When Billy heard the woman s footsteps  he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane   As his unsuspecting victim drew close  the beggar moaned and shouted  and cried out for help   Trembling with excitement  the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay concealed   She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch  when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes   In a few minutes it was all over   The woman lay in a dead faint  and Billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his   bowl    his victirn s purse snug in his coat pocket   An hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition  but failed to give a description of her assailant   And  as  Billy in the Bowl  had figured  nobody would suspect a deformed beggar   Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan  always shifting the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter   On one occasion   Billy in  the Bowl   tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her   The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder and caused a great stir   Hundred s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months  Billy in the Bowl  was forced to desert his usual haunts   Around this period  Dublin s first ever police force was been mobilised  and the first case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder   Months passed and   Billy in the Bowl  reverted once again to his old pasttime   A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed  and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district   But the beggar still rolled along in his  bowl  pitied and unsuspected   Then came the night that finished Billy s career of crime   Two stoudy built female cooks  trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city  were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help   Rushing over  they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch   Billy  thinking there was only one woman  grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch   She proved much too strong for him  however  and while resisting tore  at his face with her sharp finger nails   Meanwhile  her companion acted with speed and daring   Pulling out her large hatpin she made  for the beggar  and plunged the pin into his right eye   The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene   Among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy    Billy in the Bowl  was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence  but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl   The Grangegorman Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet  attractive Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled  and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night     daev                                  Rev   Dave  daev  Walsh  daev

Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand ALB  Thu Aug 29 10 19 AM ET ALB  By Andrew Marshall  ALB  BANGKOK  Thailand  Reuters    English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand ALB  looking for a wife  It took two hours to find her   ALB   The first day I went out with Wan  she came back to my hotel and hung all ALB  my clothes up and tidied the room  I thought it was marvelous   he said   I ALB  knew then there was something special    ALB  Moylan  49  is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet ALB     and marry    Thai women  He lives in England now with 28 year old Wan  ALB  who is expecting their first child   ALB  Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women ALB  in developing countries  offering dreams of a new life in the West that ALB  often turn sour  But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand ALB  in search of a wife   ALB   I got to Thailand at 2 p m   and by 4 p m  I d met Wan   he said   I knew I ALB  found her attractive  I could tell straight away that she was very caring    ALB  Moylan spent a week in Thailand  and after returning to England kept in ALB  touch with Wan by phone and mail  Six months later she came to England and ALB  the couple married   ALB  MR  MARRIAGE  ALB  Lawrence Lynch  49  runs Thai Professional Introduction Services  the agency ALB  Moylan used to meet his wife  Lynch  who calls himself  Mr  Marriage   ALB  started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction ALB  agency   ALB  Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages   ALB   In the last five years we ve done about 400   he said   To the best of my ALB  knowledge  they have all been successful    ALB  Male clients pay  2 213 for the service  although men from countries that ALB  require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount  ALB  Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women ALB  looking for a husband  If they like what they see they come to Bangkok   ALB  Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch s ALB  office    encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and ALB  language problems   ALB   We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies   ALB  Lynch said   But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax    ALB  After the first meeting  couples can decide to go on dates to get to know ALB  each other better  Within two weeks of arrival  Lynch says  almost every ALB  client has found a potential wife   ALB   At the end of a fortnight it s very  very rare for a guy to go back and ALB  think he hasn t made his mind up   he said  In most cases  marriage follows  ALB  usually within the next year   ALB  Roongthip Kamchat  managing director of Thai No  1 Connections  a ALB  Bangkok based agency  says she has introduced about 1 000 couples  and less ALB  than 10 percent have broken up   ALB  Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just ALB  arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife   ALB   Sometimes they are very nervous   she said   And sometimes they are very ALB  impatient and say  Give me a lady  I want to get married now   I say   Calm ALB  down  OK  we ll talk     ALB  But if men are really in a hurry  Roongthip says  she can find them a wife ALB  and get them married within a week  Lynch says clients he has found wives ALB  for include a blind man  a man with one leg and a man with post traumatic ALB  stress disorder   ALB  WHY   ALB  Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries  Critics ALB  say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to ALB  form relationships in their own country  and on the desperation of ALB  impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West   ALB  But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy  there is ALB  no reason to object   If you talk about people who are needy  I think ALB  everybody wants someone to love them  and wants someone to love  so yes  I ALB  need Wan   he said   ALB   Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand  I think there s no ALB  secret there  They are looking for a better life  I don t have a problem ALB  with that  In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to ALB  their future husband    ALB  Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too  and that is why they ALB  choose to use his agency   ALB  His brochure promises an alternative to the  kind of de feminized  ALB  over sized  self centered  mercenary minded lady available on the British ALB  singles scene   and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are ALB  not  God s gift to women    ALB  Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their ALB  own countries    and found Thai women attractive   ALB   They don t know how to meet women  Even if they go to pubs or discotheques ALB  or restaurants or department stores  how can they ask people to marry them  ALB  Impossible   she said   ALB   Many Thai girls are slim  have long hair  black eyes  small nose  They are ALB  good at taking care and joking and laughing  not strict  Different from ALB  ladies from other countries    ALB  Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap  ALB  the agencies say this is not a problem  They say language problems are also ALB  not a major obstacle   ALB   Thai ladies are not ageist  and they have no qualms whatsoever about having ALB  a husband who is significantly older   Lynch said   When I met my wife she ALB  couldn t speak a word of English  We muddled along with a phonetic ALB  dictionary  The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up ALB  very quickly    ALB  Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move ALB  to the West   ALB   We have kitchens  we have study classes   Roongthip said   We teach them ALB  how to eat  and when to make tea    ALB  PITFALLS  ALB  But not all dreams come true   Bee  is a 26 year old Thai woman who went to ALB  Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency  Now she is ALB  back in Bangkok  sad and angry   ALB   He had no friends  and I was so lonely   she said   I tried to make him ALB  happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean  He never ALB  spoke to me    ALB  Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year   I thought I would be happy ALB  there   she said   But it was the worst time of my life    ALB  Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run  he makes checks to ensure ALB  unsuitable candidates are weeded out   ALB   We are ethical and professional   he said   We will not take on all ALB  comers    ALB  Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls  his own marriage is proof the ALB  arrangement can work  Wan s sister has just signed up with Lynch s company  ALB  looking for a foreign husband   ALB   Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited  I m sure there are   ALB  Moylan said   But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal           Best regards

sounding units  MSUs  on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS N satellites to get accurate  direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth  including remote deserts  rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available   The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data  A recent study  1  found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations   Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed  it is placed in a  public  computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U S  and abroad  It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change  and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change     GATHERING THE DATA  While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air  a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere  Each of the more than 30 000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75 000 cubic kilometers of air   The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere  The intensity of the microwave emissions   their  brightness    varies according to temperature   Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset     VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS  A recent comparison  1  of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems   microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons   found a  remarkable  level of agreement between the two   To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units  Christy compared temperature readings recorded by  radiosonde  thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites   He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16 year period of the study  The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0 03 degrees Celsius  about 0 054  Fahrenheit  per decade  The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions    The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement   Christy said   If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites  that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else    The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0 155 degrees Celsius  about 0 28  Fahrenheit  per decade since 1979  Over those 99 spots on the globe  the satellites also recorded a warming trend  0 128 degrees Celsius  about 0 23  Fahrenheit  per decade   Globally  however  the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0 03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS N satellites went into service    These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet   Christy said   They are not representative of the total globe    Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world  usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time  As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere  the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio   While there are more than 1 000 radiosonde launch sites globally  the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected  Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long term systematic and reliable data collection  These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland  Trinidad  Truk Island and Alaska   In an earlier study  an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17 year climate trend of  0 05  C per decade  which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time  Christy said     GLOBAL COVERAGE  One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage  Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe  Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours   The  global temperature  that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method  It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions  including Antarctica  the Brazilian rain forests  the Sahara Desert and Greenland   The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground based thermometers  More than 5 000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists   Most of these thermometers  which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground  are in areas easily accessible to people  In the U S  and other industrial countries  these thermometers are most often found at airports   The ground based network is extensive in North America  Europe  Russia  China and Japan  It is less comprehensive in Africa  South America  Australia and across much of Southern Asia   Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons   Radiosonde  balloons are released from stations around the world  usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time   While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world  they are concentrated in industrial nations  There are more than 1 000 radiosonde launch sites globally  If they were evenly distributed around the world  that would equal approximately one for every 195 000 square miles of the Earth s surface   Water temperatures  which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures  come from thermometers on piers and buoys  and aboard  ships of opportunity   The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines  The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage  tending instead to be concentrated in heavily travelled shipping lanes  and in harbors   In the past 12 years  a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established  gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data     INSTRUMENT ACCURACY  MSU  With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years  a method was devised to merge all the data into a single  consistent time series   Each satellite has its own bias that  if not calculated and removed  would introduce spurious trends  The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time  Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years  and were sufficient to determine these biases   Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations  the biases between the satellites are known to within 0 01 deg  The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base   2   To check the final product  comparisons were made over a 16 year period with balloon measurements as stated above  and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate     INSTRUMENT ACCURACY  GROUND BASED THERMOMETERS  Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings  Since most thermometers for which long term records exist are in towns and cities  the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads  parking lots  runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization  This temperature change may be an artifact of a local  asphalt effect  rather than a long term widespread climate change     INSTRUMENT ACCURACY  SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY  While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature  this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface   the level from which water is drawn into the ships   The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard  nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places   Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy     THE SCIENTISTS  In 1996  Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society s Special Award  They were honored  for developing a global  precise

      "  I wanted to get back to this but didn t have the time   I actually lived on a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota Sioux country as well   And my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than I have  my experience being a direct result of living with my parents    I do get a lot of my information first hand  or in some cases  second hand from my father   The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading  mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income   While it is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty  it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe  not something that was impressed upon them   The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals  typically an  Indian Corporation  of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share  the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe    In most tribes  a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation  usually to the tune of  10 30k per person  depending on the tribe   The dividend money comes from a number of places  with the primary sources being the Federal Gov t and various businesses assets owned by the Indian corporation   You have to understand a couple things   First  a great many Indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises   Everyone gets a check for their share no matter what   One of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment  often 70 90   for tribal members  who are more than happy take their dividend and not work   The dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole  income  for government accounting purposes   Unfortunately  to support this type of economics when no one works  they ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends   Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works   One of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn  many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk  not Indians   Second  even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend  they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually   By benefits and perks  we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government   It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are ineptly run  and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians  a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non Indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions   An example of this is the Haida Corporation  which while having less 1 000 tribal shareholders  has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the  200 300 million range  and growing    Yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled  about  20k in this particular case  and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use   They don t eat their seed corn  and have actually managed to grow their stash   In contrast  a couple islands over  there is another tribe of  2 000 people that has a net loss of about  50 million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets   This particular tribe has a modest income in theory  but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars  and many borrow money against future income   Incidentally  in this particular case  the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year  much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets   Somewhat annoying  the Federal government semi regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they ve burned through the ones previously given where feasible  typically selling the assets to American or foreign companies   And the cycle continues   So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems   In a nutshell  a thoroughly pathological culture and society   Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant   Incest  rape  and gross promiscuity is rampant   Inbreeding  heavy drug abuse during pregnancy  and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded   Many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity  mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above   On one reservation my parents lived  the HIV infection rate was  70    Many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt  and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious  they do have their own judges  courts  police etc    In short  many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I have ever seen anywhere   Because of their legal status  there really aren t that many consequences for their behavior   There are many things that I could tell you that I ve seen that you probably would not believe unless you d seen it yourself   There are always good people in these tribes  but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times  and this IS a mobocracy typically    BTW  if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs  try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations   It will give you an interesting perspective on things    There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous Indians   The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely   The second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part  even if they maintain their tribal identity   In both of these cases  the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above   The Indians are often quite wealthy technically  and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita   And the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole   It is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income   The poverty is social and cultural in nature  not economic   This was my original point    On a tangent   One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi tribal corporate socialism   Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mind bogglingly bad in execution   That they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything   But what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run   It is like a Family Corporation writ large   It seems that in a future where  familial  ties will be increasingly voluntary  the general concept may have some merit in general Western society  serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics  but with an arbitrary set of self selecting individuals   Damn that was long  and its late   and it could have been a lot longer    James Rogers jamesr best com    On 9 22 02 3 53

      " One of the most bizarre pages I ve seen on the Web  At first I thought it might be some sort of back story to a RPG  but  nope  it looks like somebody believes this         M09  Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil  DINOSAURS  Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on their hind legs  This is a description of a dinosaur  It now appears in Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs  dinosaurs and dragons are all linked together and that they all originated on Earth  The Erideans who are Reptoid derivatives have a home planet  in the Eridanus system  like all other ETs  The Reptoids have no reported home planet  They also come over as entities with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit  This is a description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see them  Thus it could be that the Reptoids  Erideans  Nordics  Anunnaki  but not the Greys  all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth even if they choose to live elsewhere  The Greys do not appear to have a renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth  The definitive work on dragons is  The Flight of Dragons  by Peter Dickinson  If dragons did exist in the flesh  they did not survive the long bow  Targets do not come much bigger   Truth is stranger than fiction  Thus the writer s current scenario is that there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard their eggs and young  and who probably preferred to live underground  They survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty  They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet  for them  possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control   Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the dinosaurs  They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also to appear to some people  They have appeared to the writer in remote viewing  They are living on as vampire entities  Such immortal minds are contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers  If they can be encouraged to reincarnate  then the power sources of the black magicians and mind controllers will disappear  Encouraging them to reincarnate will help so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great difficulty surviving reincarnation  Purging people s dinosaurs should remove all perverse psychic abilities not under their control  They are a source of Satanic Guardian Angels and demons  They control us by owning our psi  Thus if we regain ownership of psi  we must relinquish their control and that of all other mind controllers  Encourage people to regain ownership of their psi   THE ORIGINS OF LOVE  HATE AND PURE MALICE  The following scenario appears to hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious   Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of rotting vegetation  a good source of beetles and grubs for young hatchelings   They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm  which made them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change  In order to keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control  To do this they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators  This is an act of hatred and outward looking  While a few dinosaurs did develop the ability to bear living young  most did not  The dinosaurs got in first and so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds  They have become the source of all Satans  devils and demons   Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep them warm  A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs  say one per day  and only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid  Thus all eggs tend to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth  This is primarily an act of love but inward looking  Bearing live young is not suitable to a bird of the air  A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far  Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm  even if they are standing on ice   Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act of love and inward looking  This is especially true as a mammalian female can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird sitting on a nest   Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young  while birds and mammals developed love  Birds and mammals certainly do hate all enemies of their young  but this is secondary   If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician  then purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs  Unfortunately most of our religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control  regardless of the front they put out to the public  Religion tends to concentrate on  How to Brainwash your Neighbour   Conscious thought has built many mighty empires  theologies and slave control systems out of using  How to care for and protect one s young  as a foundation   Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something  A load of dinosaur s eggs   Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur s eggs of any entity tends to purge all malice back to its roots   It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings  aided and abetted by various occultists and other  As they will insist on vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the serenity of the writer  he encourages them to reincarnate   ITEMS FOR INSPECTION  For mind control to take place  then someone must take control or ownership of the target s psi and pleasure centres  Check for the following   Nest of dinosaur s eggs  holy dinosaurs  etc  Eggs  controllers or owners in peoples psi  pleasure centres  pain killing hormones  abilities  etc  Mind machines  The original engraving or engram  GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right  T hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams  No doubt dinosaurs were the first job holders  TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of time   My  our  Man s timetracks  etc  The time tracks of the Universe  Universal Subconscious  Galactic Subconscious  etc  EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode  Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices  Whenever one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes  suspect that the higher plane is a vampire one  One may never know what they looked like or other basic characteristics  which makes linking back a trifle difficult  Every extinct race  etc  BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via genetic linkages  Some of these can be over 2 000 years old  Every blood ancestor  ancestral mind  genetic mind  etc   \n",

only images is going to only have IMG tags interspersed with table  paragraph and linebreak tags  and some whitespace  so there would be a lot of IMG tags with no plain text  non whitespace  between them   So I defined consecutive IMG tags to be ones with no text between them  and looked at the longest run of consecutive IMGs within a message   This one seems to do pretty good  because in my non spam corpus there s only a handful of messages with IMG runs larger than two   0 450    1 418    0 000    1 00    0 78    0 01  T HTML CONSEC IMGS06 0 232    0 730    0 000    1 00    0 74    0 01  T

weren t exactly poor to start   with   Actually  if I remember correctly from discussion of the list s composition in Forbes about five or six years ago  the  best  way to get on the Forbes 400 is to have  no  college at all  Can you say  Bootstraps   boys and girls  I knew you could        The  next  category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a  terminal  professional degree  like an MBA  PhD  MD  etc   from the best school possible   Why  Because  as of about 1950  the  best  way to get into Harvard  for instance  is to be  smart   not rich  Don t take my word for it  ask their admissions office  Look at the admissions stats over the years for proof   Meritocracy  American Style  was  invented  at the Ivy League after World War II  Even Stanford got the hint       and  of course  Chicago taught them all how  right       Practically  nobody  who goes to a top 20 American institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days  Unless  of course  their parents  who couldn t afford to go there themselves  got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so  And their kids  still  had to get the grades  and  biased   by intelligence       test scores  to get in    The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with  terminal  degrees  until they actually  own  something and  hire  people  or learn to  make  something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis  persist in the practically insane belief  like life after death  that economics is some kind of zero sum game  that dumb people who don t work hard for it make all the money  and  if someone  is  smart  works hard  and is rich  then they stole their wealth somehow   BTW  none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame  me  for the fact that I m using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders  You were  apparently  too dumb to grab the right end   I  went to Missouri  and  I  don t have a degree in anything actually useful  much less a  terminal  one  which means  I  m broker than anyone on this list    it s just that  you   of all people  lots with educations far surpassing my own  should just plain know better  The facts speak for themselves  if you just open your eyes and  look   There are no epicycles  the universe does not orbit the earth  and economics is not a zero sum game  The cost of anything  including ignorance and destitution  is the forgone alternative  in this case  intelligence and effort       BTW  if we ever actually  had  free markets in this country   including  the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes  all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have  more  money  and there would be  more  self made people on that list  In addition  most of the people who  inherited  money on the list would have  much  less of it  not even relatively speaking  Finally  practically all of that  new  money would have come from economic efficiency and not  stolen  from someone else  investment bubbles or not   That efficiency is called  progress   for those of you in The People s Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge  It means more and better stuff  cheaper  over time    a terrible  petit bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite  or you d know about it by now  In economic terms  it s also called an increase in general welfare  and  no  Virginia  I m not talking about extorting money from someone who works  and giving it to someone who doesn t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as Santa Claus come election time      In short  then  economics is not a zero sum game  property is not theft  the rich don t get rich off the backs of the poor  and redistributionist

it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs  i don t think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography   developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc  i think it expands the market and forms a new category  the extent of the category size is the big question  will it be a fad or will it a sustained market   that s consumer behavior and marketing  but i don t think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market  in this case  digital photos or normal photos   europe s the one to watch   more

on pricing    i am  mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting     my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways  once there are a billion  eye s  which can instantly share what they see  amongst each other   that doesn t mean that people will stop talking on  their phones  or that people will spend more time w images than voice   just  that it is fundamental   from news to crime to privacy to dating to family  life to bloopers and practical jokes  i believe there will be an explosion  of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of  their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of  photography by orders of magnitude and in short order  and yes  changes  things  big time      rgds

mistake  the content is the users   communications   its anything and everything   avg person could easily send   half dozen pics to a dozen people a day   mainly humorous i d guess  who   cares if content is trivial in nature  picture speaks a thousand words     This does nothing to answer my question   I  do  care about content   Hell   if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth  all day  I d have a different opinion of this   I just am not convinced  that they will  stupid or not      While a picture may be worth a thousand words  and this is the same  argument the guy who works for me made   how many people do you know who  communicate by pictures   Sure  it sounds nice to say that a picture is  such an efficient messaging mechanism  but how often do you actually find  yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something     I don t buy it     For most messages  text works fine and is the most efficient  mechanism   For some messages  pictures do the job  but I would say not  nearly as often as words   Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and  such are games   Because images are usually not the most efficient way to  get a message across      misc ramblings  i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same   thing about  1 hour photo  processing   trivial  who needs it  i get better   resultion elswhere   and yet  it had great decentralizing impact   the  plant   had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation   the digital  camera    and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of   decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion  which will put the   photo giants to bed  and change the world in a meaningful way   also  SMS   didn t take off because its easy  it took off because it costs less   its   greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the  profitabilty  of their SMS   traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth   in reality    SMS cannibilizes the voice rev s they bought their networks to handle     Again  this is the same argument my colleague made  along with  you just  don t understand kids today  and they ll run with this     I wasn t saying  that MMS wouldn t take off because it wasn t high quality or that it wasn t  easy   I was saying that I couldn t see why people would use it in a way  that  changed the face of communications      I m looking for the compelling reason  even if it s a stupid one  why  people would want to do this   Sure  if they integrate cameras into the  phone  and the quality improves  even only marginally  I can certainly see  people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to  other people   But  mostly  I don t see what the benefit is to this over  sending them to someone s email address  or putting together an online  or  offline  photoalbum     I don t think 1 hour photos are trivial   People want to see their own pics  right away  and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots   That s  one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on   The instant  view part   I m guessing your argument is that people not only want   instant view   but also  instant show    Which is what this service  offers   I m not convinced that most people want  instant show    I think  people like to package their pictures and show them   That s why people put  together fancy albums  and sit there and force you to go through them while  they explain every picture   Sure  occasionally  instant show  is nice  but  it s just  nice  on occasion   I still can t see how it becomes a integral  messaging method     What s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it  from one phone to another   There has to be  some  benefit  even if it s  silly if people are going to flock to it     I m searching    no one has given me a straight answer yet     The  only  really intriguing idea I ve heard about things like MMS lately  are Dan Gillmor s assertion that one day in the near future some news event  will happen  and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile  phones  from all different angles  and those photos tell the real story of  what happened   before the press even gets there     Willing to be proven wrong   Mike    PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as  they

      " URL   Date  Not supplied  Daniel Berlinger has noticed that Mac software shops are starting to move to OS X only development  This makes sense  for two reasons  First  most people who pay for software have new computers  So while OS X may only have a small fraction of the installed base  it has the majority of the population of people who are opening their wallets  Second  if OS X isn t successful  the Mac is   over   It s not like System 9 is getting any more popular   Then again  there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right business decision to develop software for the Macintosh  Developing for the Mac is not a whole lot different than creating a web site  that only works on Netscape    Given the market share of Macs  about 3 5   and the market share of Netscape  about 3 4    that is not a silly comparison    Robb Beal wrote   Try this test  Go to a venture firm  angel  or big company with a Mac OS X product concept prototype  Do they consider the fact that it s a Mac application a net plus   No    Well  duh   Your product would have to appeal to  25 times more Mac  users    than Windows users just to break even  In other words  if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 Windows users  you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same amount of money   Now  you may want to make an  emotional  appeal to developing for the Mac  That s fine  If you like Macs and you re doing it for fun  more power to ya   But as long as we re talking  investment   you have to tell me why you re going to get 25 times as many users  Maybe there s less competition in your category on the Mac  maybe you re in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs dominate  they don t  it just seems that way because the elite graphics people in big American cities use Macs   maybe your product can t sell to mixed environments unless it runs everywhere  But if you want to make an investment in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you re going to overcome that magic 25 multiplier            \n",

                                                   It may seem like all Iraq  all the time in the Oval Office  but the president has at least one other thing on his mind this week  that pesky port lockout  The freight still isn t moving  factories are running out of parts  produce is rotting  and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day   On Monday  Bush stepped in and appointed a three member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy   We hope this isn t a difficult question  as the panel s been given all of one day to report back   When Bush gets the report on Tuesday  the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft Hartley Act  That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages   Invoking Taft Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety    not the economy  But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday  saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military  we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere    Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10 day shutdown   said the L A  Times  but an anonymous Bush administration official  said that only a portion of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore    Politically  this has been a tricky one  Using Taft Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections  On the other hand   Voter discontent with Bush s handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls  and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration   said the San Francisco Chronicle  Also  Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the economy   Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout  Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy  andmerited federal intervention   said the AP   As for Taft Hartley  it s not exactly famous for solving labor disputes  Often the 80 day cooling off period ends  and workers simply walk out again  or get locked out again  in this case   One gets the sense  however  that fixing the dockworkers  contract isn t the point of this particular 80 days  It s 78 days until Christmas  The race is on    Jen Muehlbauer  President Acts To Halt Port Lockout for 80 Days  Seattle Times

                                 wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry  fowl   We mean  foul   The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces  the better to compete with Big Cable  Federal regulators  both the FCC and the Justice Department  are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95  of satellite service in the US   The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics    it was described as being worth anywhere from  15 billion and  25 billion  It was a challenge to keep the players straight  as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents  and others referred to the service monikers  Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish  All straight   The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on  read  rejecting  the merger until the Justice Department has spoken  EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified  major revisions  to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks   The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take    specifically  selling some frequencies to Cablevision  The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company s plans and past spending on such a project   TheStreet com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space  It seems the market for expanded service television may be nearing saturation  TheStreet com quoted an analyst s report which concluded   Consumers should benefit from     continued rivalry  but shareholders may realize much smaller returns    The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings  Last year Murdoch s News Corp  bid for DirecTV  but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar  If the current deal falls through  he ll be

                 P It may seem like all Iraq  all the time in the Oval Office  but the president has at least one other thing on his mind this week  that pesky port lockout  The freight still isn t moving  factories are running out of parts  produce is rotting  and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day    P  P  On Monday  Bush stepped in and appointed a three member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy   We hope this isn t a difficult question  as the panel s been given all of one day to report back   When Bush gets the report on Tuesday  the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft Hartley Act  That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages   P  P  Invoking Taft Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety    not the economy  But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday  saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military  we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere    Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10 day shutdown   said the L A  Times  but an anonymous Bush administration official  said that only a portion of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore    P  P  Politically  this has been a tricky one  Using Taft Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections  On the other hand   Voter discontent with Bush s handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls  and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration   said the San Francisco Chronicle  Also  Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the economy   Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout  Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy  andmerited federal intervention   said the AP    P  P  As for Taft Hartley  it s not exactly famous for solving labor disputes  Often the 80 day cooling off period ends  and workers simply walk out again  or get locked out again  in this case   One gets the sense  however  that fixing the dockworkers  contract isn t the point of this particular 80 days  It s 78 days until Christmas  The race is on    Jen Muehlbauer  P  P  President Acts To Halt Port Lockout for 80 Days  Seattle Times  br   A HREF

dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces  the better to compete with Big Cable  Federal regulators  both the FCC and the Justice Department  are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95  of satellite service in the US   P  P  The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics    it was described as being worth anywhere from  15 billion and  25 billion  It was a challenge to keep the players straight  as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents  and others referred to the service monikers  Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish  All straight   P  P  The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on  read  rejecting  the merger until the Justice Department has spoken  EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified  major revisions  to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks   P  P  The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take    specifically  selling some frequencies to Cablevision  The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company s plans and past spending on such a project   P  P  TheStreet com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space  It seems the market for expanded service television may be nearing saturation  TheStreet com quoted an analyst s report which concluded   Consumers should benefit from     continued rivalry  but shareholders may realize much smaller returns    P  P  The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings  Last year Murdoch s News Corp  bid for DirecTV  but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar  If the current deal falls through  he ll be back    Keith Dawson  P  P  EchoStar and Hughes Propose Concessions in Bid to Save Deal

      " I got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of his reign at the FCC   He said they were going to take a real hands off approach  so it s funny that they would blame the regulators for causing the collapse   One thing he did get right  is that he wasn t worried that the US was behind Europe in the wireless licensing spectrum   This is something very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for very little benefit   His legacy was is supposed to be rethinking the FCC s role to stay out of the way in this period of business innovation in the wireless space as he didn t want the government forcing business models onto the private sector   His full transcript is here    Interestingly enough I got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole CTIA 2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers   Clay and I hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo support for Craig Barrett    His message was that there s no difference between wired and wireless Internet  it s all the same thing  Instead of scalable networks  we should be thinking about scalable content    using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with the content scaling back for each target platform    The best part of the whole trip wasn t hobnobbing at all  but really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms  They decided to put us up in one of their  10 000 night high roller rooms   They put Clay in one and me in another  The Venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms anywhere  but these ones were bigger than my whole house  8    Greg        Rohit Khare wrote    I can t believe I actually read a laugh out loud funny profile of the    FCC Commissioner  fer crissakes  So the following article comes   recommended  a fine explanation of Michael Powell s extraordinary   equivocation      On the other hand  I can also agree with Werbach s Werblog entry    Rohit      A Trip to F C C  World       Nicholas Lemann has a piece in the New Yorker this week about FCC    Chairman Michael Powell   It s one of the first articles I ve seen    that captures some of Powell s real personality  and the way he s    viewed in Washington   Unfortunately  Lemann ends by endorsing    conventional political wisdom   After describing how Powell isn t    really a fire breathing ideological conservative  he concludes that     in essence  Powell favors the inumbent local Bell telephone companies     while a Democratic FCC would favor new entrants   I know that s not    how Powell sees the world  and though I disagree with him on many    issues  I think he s right to resist the old dichotomy        The telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who    went through it   The disaster wasn t the regulators  fault  as some    conservatives argue   But something clearly went horribly wrong  and    policy makers should learn from that experience   Contrary to Lemann s    speculation  the upstart carriers won t be successful in a Gore    administration  because it s too late   Virtually all of them are    dead  and Wall Street has turned off the capital tap for the    foreseeable future   Some may survive  but as small players rather    than world dominators        The battle between CLECs and RBOCs that Lemann so astutely parodies is    old news   The next important battle in telecom will be between those    who want to stay within the traditional boxes  and those who use    different models entirely   That s why open broadband networks and    open spectrum are so important   Whatever the regulatory environment     there is going to be consolidation in telecom   Those left out in that    consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into    the home  or slowly die  The victors in the consolidation game will    cut back on innovation and raise prices  which will create further    pressure for alternatives        Lemann is right that policy making looks much drier and more ambiguous    on the ground than through the lens of history   But he s wrong in    thinking that telecom s future will be something like its past        Friday  October 04  2002    11 17 11 AM  comments  0                                                                              THE CHAIRMAN   by NICHOLAS LEMANN   He s the other Powell  and no one is sure what he s up to    New Yorker  October 8  2002     Last year  my middle son  in eighth grade and encountering his first   fairly serious American history course  indignantly reported that the   whole subject was incomprehensible  I was shocked  What about Gettysburg   and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma to Montgomery march    Just look at my textbook  he said  and when I did I saw his point  His   class had got up to the eighteen forties  What I expected was a big   beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks  and  in deed    there was some of that  But the main difference between my son s text   and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous   decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American   history  There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and   reciprocal trade agreements  I skipped ahead  past the Civil War  hoping   for easier going  only to encounter currency floats and the regulation   of freight rates  Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it   become possible to see the federal government s main function as   responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice    instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests      Even now  if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty   speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington  what you d find   is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage  not so   much over the public as over each other  agribusiness versus real   estate  banks versus insurance companies  and so on  The arena in which   this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and   commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them  It s   an insider s game  less because the players are secretive than because   the public and the press encouraged by the players  who speak in jargon    can t get themselves interested      One corner of Washington might be called F C C  World  for the Federal   Communications Commission  F C C  World has perhaps five thousand   denizens  They work at the commission itself  at the House and Senate   commerce committees  and at the Washington offices of the companies that   the commission regulates  They read Communications Daily  subscription   price   3 695 a year   and every year around Christmastime they   grumblingly attend the Chairman s Dinner  at a Washington hotel  where   the high point of the evening is a scripted  supposedly self deprecating   comedy routine by the commission s chairman      Of all the federal agencies and commissions  the F C C  is the one that   Americans ought to be most interested in  after all  it is involved with   a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the   American economy  as well as important aspects of daily life telephone   and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet  And right now   F C C  World is in  if not a crisis  at least a very soapy lather    because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the    corporate scandals  concerns the economic collapse of companies   regulated by the F C C  Qwest  WorldCom  Adelphia  and Global Crossing    among others  are  or were  part of F C C  World  AOL Time Warner is   part of F C C  World  Jack Grubman  the former Salomon Smith Barney   analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay  of Enron  as the   embodiment of the corporate scandals  is part of F C C  World  In the   past two years  companies belonging to F C C  World have lost trillions   of dollars in stock market valuation  and have collectively served as a   dead weight pulling down the entire stock market      This year  an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state   of the F C C  has been circulating widely within F C C  World  It evokes   F C C  World s feverish mood   The F C C  is fiddling while Rome burns     and suggests why nobody besides residents of F C C  World has thought of   the commission in connection with the corporate scandals  The sentence I   just quoted is followed by this explanation   The ILECs appear likely to   enter all l d  markets within twelve months  while losing virtually no   residential customers to attackers since 1996  and suffering about 10    market share loss in business lines to CLECs   It s a lot easier to   think about evil C E O s than to decipher that        Even in good times  F C C  World pays obsessive attention to the   commission s chairman  In bad times  the attention becomes especially   intense  and when the chairman is a celebrity F C C  World devotes   itself to full time chairman watching  The current chairman  Michael   Powell  is a celebrity  at least by government official standards    because he is the only son of Colin Powell  the Secretary of State    Unlike his father  he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity  which   generates enormous  and at times apoplectically toned  speculation about   who he really is and what he s really up to  Powell is young to be the   head of a federal agency he is thirty nine and genially charming    Everybody likes him  Before becoming chairman  he was for three years   one of the F C C  s five commissioners  not only is he fluent in the   F C C  s incomprehensible patois  he has a Clintonesque love of the   arcane details of communications policy  He s always saying that he s an    avid moderate   And yet he has a rage inciting quality  One of his   predecessors as chairman  Reed Hundt  quoted in Forbes  compared Powell   to Herbert Hoover  Mark Cooper  of the Consumer Federation of America    calls him  radical and extreme   Just as often as he s accused of being   a right wing ideologue  Powell gets accused of being paralytically   cautious   It ain t about singing  Kum Ba Yah  around the campfire     another former chairman  William Kennard  says   You have to have an   answer   One day last spring  Powell  testifying before a Senate   subcommittee  delivered an anodyne opening statement  and the   subcommittee s chairman  Ernest Hollings  of South Carolina  berated   him   You don t care about these regulations   Hollings said   You don t   care about the law or what Congress sets down        That s the   fundamental  That s the misgiving I have of your administration over   there  It just is amazing to me  You just pell mell down the road and   seem to not care at all  I think you d be a wonderful executive   vice president of a chamber of commerce  but not a chairman of a   regulatory commission at the government level  Are you happy in your job        Extremely   Powell said  with an amiable smile        One cannot understand Powell s maddening effect  at least on Democrats   and liberal activists  without understanding not just the stated purpose   of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose  The F C C  was   created by Congress in 1934  but it existed in prototype well before the   New Deal  because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy   cases for government intervention in the private economy  making sure   that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves  Its   other original function was preventing American Telephone   Telegraph    the national monopoly phone company  from treating its customers   unfairly  Over the decades  as F C C  World grew up into a comfortable    well established place  the F C C  segued into the role of industrial   supervision its real purpose  It was supposed to manage the competition   among communications companies so that it didn t become too bloody  by   artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business    In addition to looking out for the public s interest  the commission   more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress  many   of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most   terrifying category of interest group you can cross the local bank   president and live to tell the tale  but not the local broadcaster    According to an oft told F C C  World anecdote  President Clinton once   blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers   in the same city because  he said  if the so and so who owned the   anti Clinton Little Rock Democrat Gazette had owned the leading TV   station in Little Rock  too  Clinton would never have become President        F C C  World may have been con tentious  but it was settled  too    because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic   niches for themselves  Then  in the nineteen eighties  the successful   breakup of A T    T  by far the biggest and most important company the   commission regulated deposited a thick additional sediment of   self confidence onto the consciousness of F C C  World  A generation   ago  for most Americans  there was one local phone company  one   long distance company  and one company that manufactured telephones    which customers were not permitted to own and they were all the same   company  It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line  By the   mid nineteen nineties  there were a dozen economically viable local   phone companies  a handful of national long distance companies competing   to offer customers the lowest price and best service  and stores   everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers and   millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the   telephone lines  A T    T  had argued for years that it was a  natural   monopoly   requiring protection from economic competition and total   control over its lines  So much for that argument  Over the same period    the F C C  had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones   and the Internet  It was the dream of federal agency success come true    consumers vastly better served  and the industry much bigger and more   prosperous  too      The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996    one of those massive  endlessly lobbied over pieces of legislation which   most people outside F C C  World probably felt it was safe to ignore    Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of   modernization and deregulation  its essence was a grand interest group   bargain  in which the local phone companies  known to headline writers   as  baby Bells  and to F C C  World as  arbocks   the pronounced version   of RBOCs  or regional Bell operating companies   would be permitted to   offer long distance service in exchange for letting the long distance   companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for   customers  Consumers would win  because for the first time they would   get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more   competition than they already had in long distance  But the politics and   economics of the Telecom Act  which was shepherded through Congress by   Vice President Gore  were just as important  Democrats saw the act as   helping to reposition them as the technology party the party that   brought the Internet into every home  created hundreds of thousands of   jobs in new companies  and  not least  set off an investment boom whose   beneficiaries might become the party s new contributor base  Clinton s   slogans about the  information superhighway  and  building a bridge to   the twenty first century   which  like all Clinton slogans  artfully   sent different messages to different constituencies  were the rhetorical   correlates of the Telecom Act  and Gore s cruise to the Presidency was   supposed to be powered substantially by the act s success      The F C C  had a crucial role in all this  The arbocks are rich    aggressive  politically powerful  and generally Republican  though like   all important interest groups they work with both parties   they   immediately filed lawsuits  which wound up tying the hands of their new   competitors in the local phone market for more than three years  Through   rule making  enforcement  and litigation  the F C C   then headed by   Reed Hundt  who was Gore s classmate at St  Albans  was supposed to keep   the arbocks in their cages  so that not only long distance companies   like A T    T  and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new   companies   see lecks   the pronounced version of CLECs  or competitive   local exchange carriers   could emerge  This entailed the regulatory   equivalent of hand to hand combat  the see leck is supposed to have   access to the arbock s switching equipment  the arbock won t give the   seeleck a key to the room where it s kept  so the see leck asks the   F C C  to rule that the arbock has to give it the key      Partly because Hundt assured the see lecks and other new companies that   he would protect them  and partly because of the generally booming   condition of the economy then  investment capital flooded into the   see lecks companies with names like Winstar  Covad  and Teligent and   into other telecommunications companies  Even not obviously related   technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom   boom  demand for their products was supposed to come from the see lecks   and other new players  There would be no conflict between the interests   of the new telecom companies and those of consumers  as one of Hundt s   former lieutenants told me   Reed used to joke that my job was to make   sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up         The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the   boom  Wall Street had its blood up  and that meant not just more   startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies    Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together  and A T    T  and   Comcast  and so on   Surely  WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys   believed that their self dealing  stock overselling  and creative   accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating       By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been   determined  the telecom crash was well under way  Nonetheless  the   chairmanship of the F C C  remained one of the best jobs  in terms of   influence and visibility  available to a career government regulator    Three Republicans emerged as candidates  Powell  who was a commissioner    Harold Furchtgott Roth  the farthest to the right commissioner  and   Patrick Wood  the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and  as   such  a George W  Bush guy  In Texas  however  Wood had crossed the most   powerful person in the arbock camp  Edward Whitacre  the C E O  of   S B C  Communications  which is headquartered in San Antonio  This meant   that the arbocks didn t want Wood as head of the F C C   because he   might be too pro see leck   Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy   Regulatory Commission   Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he   wasn t as threatening as Wood  while also signalling the conservative   movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than   Furchtgott Roth      Powell did this deftly  For example  in December of 2000 he appeared   before a conservative group called the Progress   Freedom Foundation and   gave a very Michael Powell speech whimsical  intellectual  and   free associative  Biblical history  Joseph Schumpeter  Moore s Law  that   began by making fun of the idea that the F C C  should try to keep new   telecom companies alive   In the wake of the 1996 Act  the F C C  is   often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas   Powell said   Like the   Whos  down in Who ville  who feast on Who pudding and rare Who roast   beast  the communications industry was preparing to feast on the   deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act s   fertile soil  But this feast the F C C  Grinch did not like in the   least  so it is thought   Thus Powell was indicating that if he became   chairman he didn t expect to administer first aid to the see lecks as   part of the job  He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day   of the Bush Administration      Twenty months into the Administration  nearly all the see lecks are dead   or dying  nearly all long distance companies  not just WorldCom  are in   serious trouble  cable companies have lost half their value  satellite   companies are staggering  The crash has had an automatically   concentrating effect  because as new companies die the existing   companies  market share increases  and  if the existing companies are in   good shape financially  they have the opportunity to pick up damaged   companies at bargain prices  During the Bush Administration  as the   financial carnage in communications has worsened  the communications   industry has moved in the direction of more concentration  If the Bells   wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service  and   if they also merge  the country will be on its way to having a national   duopoly in local service  Verizon  in the East  and S B C   in the West    And these companies could dominate long distance as well  because of the   poor health of the long distance companies      The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national   companies  AOL Time Warner and Comcast  Unlike the phone companies  they   don t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more   fully control what material they allow to enter people s homes  As part   of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996   Telecom Act  the limits on concentration in the radio industry were   significantly loosened  and in the past six years the number of   radio station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty five   per cent  today  a large portion of local and national radio news   programming is supplied by a single company  Westwood One  a subsidiary   of Viacom      In this situation  many Democrats and liberals think  the F C C  should   be hyperactive the superhero of government regulation  springing to the   rescue of both consumers and the communications industry  It should try   to breathe life into the see lecks and other new companies  It should   disallow mergers  maintain ownership limits  and otherwise restrain the   forces of concentration  It should use the government s money and muscle   to get new technology especially fast Internet connections into the   homes of people who can t afford it at current market prices   An   analogy that a lot of people in F C C  World make is between telecom and   the Middle East  the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush   people  because they disengaged when they came into office  and the Bush   people blame it on the Clinton people  because they raised too many   expectations and stirred too many passions       But Michael Powell s F C C  has not been hyperactive  Powell has been   conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the   F C C  and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him   signals   In mid September  Powell finally initiated a formal review of   the F C C  s limits on media concentration   This doesn t mean he has   been inactive  rather  he has been active in a way that further   infuriates his critics in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and   the provocative  he muses about whether the fundamental premises of   F C C  World really make sense  while giving the impression that he s   having the time of his life as chairman  At his first press conference    when he was asked what he was going to do about the  digital   divide  that is  economic inequality in access to the Internet he said     You know  I think there is a Mercedes divide  I d like to have one and   I can t afford one   At the National Cable   Telecommunications   Association convention  in Chicago  Powell  following a troupe of   tumblers to the stage  interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a   somersault        Not long ago  I went to see Powell in his office at the F C C  Until   1998  when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest   Washington  near the city s open air fish market  F C C  World was at   the western edge of downtown  where everybody would encounter everybody   else at a few familiar restaurants and bars  Today  the F C C  building   looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park    Even the chairman s suite  though large  is beige  carpeted  and   fluorescent  Powell is a bulky man who wears gold rimmed glasses and   walks with a pronounced limp  the result of injuries he suffered in a   jeep accident in Germany  in 1987  when he was an Army officer  Because   of the accident  he left the Army and went to law school  where he   became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation  particularly   the idea that the government  rather than trying to correct the flaws of   the market before the fact  prophylactically   as he likes to say should   wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust   litigation to fix them  He worked briefly at a corporate law firm  and   then became a prot g  of Joel Klein  the head of the antitrust division   of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government s   legal case against Microsoft   He was recently appointed chancellor of   the New York public school system   It testifies to Powell s political   skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush   Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but   also maintains close ties to Bush s nemesis Senator John McCain  of   Arizona  One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his   enduring love of law school  It s sort of like a law school study   session over there   one Democratic former commissioner said  As if to   confirm the charge  Powell  when I arrived  introduced me to four law   students  summer interns at the commission  whom he d invited to sit in      I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions   of the F C C  For example  could private companies have apportioned the   airwaves among themselves without the government being involved       I think we ll never know   Powell said   I don t think it s an   automatically bad idea  the way some people will argue  Land is probably   the best analogue  We don t seize all the land in the United States and   say   The government will issue licenses to use land   If my neighbor   puts a fence one foot onto my property line  there s a whole body of law   about what I can do about that  including whether I can tear it down  If   a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company  it s a   similar proposition  There are scholars who argue indeed  the famous   Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this that   spectrum policy is lunacy  The market could work this out  in the kinds   of ways that we re accustomed to       Talking to Powell was fun  Unlike most high government officials  he   doesn t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding  He   slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs  He speaks in   ironic air quotes  He s like your libertarian friend in college who   enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions   about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he   sees as sentimental or illogical  After a while  I asked him whether he   thought his predecessors  excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications   Act had been excessive       I would start with a caveat   Powell said   Look  I can t fault those   judgments in and of themselves  given the time and what people thought    They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities    But  frankly  I ve always been a little bit critical  First of all    anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn t come anywhere close   to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it  by the President   on down  about the kinds of things it s going to open up  I mean  I   don t know what provisions are the information superhighway provisions    or what provisions are so digitally oriented  or some of the things that   were a big part of the theatre of its introduction  When one starts   reading the details  one searches  often in vain  for these provisions    But  nonetheless  there was a rising dot com excitement  and an Internet   excitement  and people thought this was historic legislation  and it   certainly was       But  We were sucking helium out of balloons  with the kinds of   expectations that were being bandied around  and this is before the   economy or the market even gets in trouble  It was a dramatically   exaggerated expectation by the leadership of the commission  by   politicians  by the market itself  by companies themselves  It was a   gold rush  and led to some very detrimental business decisions  ones   that government encouraged by its policies  frankly  Everybody wanted to   see numbers go up on the board       Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act       I want to see ten competitors  Twenty competitors  I want to see   thirty per cent market share  Fifty per cent market share  I want the   Bells to bleed  Then we ll know we ve succeeded     Now Powell returned   to being Powell   I think that expectation was astonishingly   unrealistic  in the short term  They wanted to see it while they re   there  We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking  And   the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking  There s no   question  we went too soon too fast  Too many companies took on too much   debt too fast before the market really had a product  or a business model       How could the Telecom Act have been handled better   We could have   chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective  and were   slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system     Powell said   Money chased what seemed like government promised   opportunity  The problem with that is there s a morning after  and we re   in it  And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem  This   debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level  In some   ways  for short term gain  we paid a price in long term stability       Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there   had been a more  reasonable  level of investment   No  we wouldn t have   every home in America with competitive choice yet but we don t anyway  I   don t think it s the remonopolization of telephone service  I don t buy   that  The Bells will prosper  but did anybody believe they wouldn t  The   part of the story that didn t materialize was that people thought so   would MCI WorldCom and Sprint       Other local phone companies  he added  hadn t materialized as viable   businesses  either  and they never might   Everybody s always saying     The regulators did this and this and this   But  candidly  the story s   quite the opposite  I think the regulators bent over backward for six   years to give them a chance  Conditions don t get that good except once   every thirty years  and it didn t happen  So  whatever the reason  we re   looking at a WorldCom that s teetering  We re looking at a long distance   business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base  A T    T  is   breaking itself up  Sprint has struggled       Could the F C C  have done anything to make the long distance companies   stronger   At the F C C   I think I ll just be blunt  My political   answer  Yes  there s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try   to help  But I can t find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere    I can t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S E C    investigation  Were I king  it would be wonderful  but I don t have   those kinds of levers  I don t know whether anybody does  At some point    companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from   dying   Powell couldn t have made it much clearer that he doesn t think   it s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash  He has   demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist   gestures in August  for example  five months after disbanding the   F C C  s Accounting Safeguards Division  Powell announced that he was   appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the   communications industry  But that shows that Powell is better at riding   out the storm than  say  Harvey Pitt  his counterpart at the Securities   and Exchange Commission  and does not mean that he plans to try to shore   up the telecom industry      I asked Powell if it would bother him if  for most people  only one   company provided cable television and only one provided local phone   service   Yes   he said   It concerns us that there s one of each of   those things  but let s not diminish the importance of there being one   of each of those things  That still is a nice suite of communications   capabilities  even if they aren t direct analogues of each other     Anyway  Powell said  before long the phone companies will be able to   provide video service over their lines  and the cable companies will   provide data service over their lines  so there will be more choice     So  yeah  we have this anxiety  we have one of everything  The question   is  Does it stay that way       The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of   information did not appear to trouble Powell  either  He said that   people confuse bigness  which brings many benefits  with concentration    which distorts markets   If this were just economics  it s easy  If you   were to say to me   Mike  just worry about economic concentration   we   know how to do that the econometrics of antitrust  I can tell you when a   market s too concentrated and prices are going to rise  The problem is   other dimensions  like political  ideological  sometimes emotional  Take   the question of  if everybody s controlling what you see  the assumption   there is that somehow there ll be this viewpoint  a monolithic   viewpoint  pushed on you by your media and you won t get diversity  I   think that s a possibility  I don t think it s nearly the possibility   that s ascribed to it sometimes       Powell explained   Sometimes when we see very pointed political or   parochial programming  it gets attacked as unfair  I see some of the   same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh   exists  They love diversity  but somehow we should run Howard Stern off   the planet  If it has a point of view  then it becomes accused of bias    and then we have policies like  here his tone went from ironic to   sarcastic  the fairness doctrine  which seems to me like the antithesis   of what I thought those people cared about  So when somebody is pointed   and opinionated  we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic   fairness and integrity or whatever  to make them balance it out         F C C  World abounds in theories about Michael Powell  One is that he   can t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries   he regulates so he talks  and talks and talks  flamboyantly about the   market  in order to buy himself time  Another is that he s carrying   water for the arbocks and the big cable companies  Another is that he is   planning to run for the Senate from Virginia  or to be appointed   Attorney General in a second Bush term   and doesn t want to do anything   at the F C C  that would diminish his chances  Another is that he s   waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action    so that he doesn t wind up going first and getting caught in the   crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television   networks   In F C C  World  this is known as the Powell Doctrine of   Telecom  after Colin Powell s idea that the United States should never   commit itself militarily without a clear objective  overwhelming force    and an exit strategy   And another is that he actually believes what he   says  and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural  healthy  and   irreversible  and more concentration would be just fine       This is why elections matter   Reed Hundt  who isn t happy about what   has become of his Telecom Act  told me  It s true that the F C C  much   more than  say  the war in Afghanistan is a case in which a Gore   Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush   Administration  Consumers might have noticed the difference by now  but   there s no question whether communications companies have noticed  The   arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would   have done if Gore had won  Next election  they ll help the party that   helped them  If the Republicans win  policy will tilt further in the   arbocks  favor  If they lose  perhaps the arbocks  rivals the   long distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts with their   friends now in power  will stage a comeback  America s present is not   unrecognizably

      "   I have translated the article in full   see end of post  I think that I ve done a far better job than the Google translation   at least it s readable now   any corrections appreciated    Stuff in    s is my  and others  additions to the debate   My apologies if I ve paraphrased anybody incorrectly  I will be glad to retract if anyone is miffed     The article makes four main points    1  Absence of critical clauses    In this case  the idea is that the licence is invalid because it doesn t specify under what country s law the GPL is governed    2  Specification in English only   That for the end user  as opposed to businesses   the GPL doesn t apply because it s not written in French    3  Arbitary licence change   The point here is that  under French law  the author can change the terms of the licence arbitarily  This is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long  where  to whom  dates and times  In the absence of such limitations  the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a whim       David Neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence   Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all  copyright holders   That s not my understanding  French law allows a GPL type licence   on condition   that the specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear   if they are not  there is nothing to stop the original author taking back  his work   The lawyers see this  correctly IMHO  as a weakness in the GPL         4  Hidden defects   Roughly  this clause means that the author s  is are liable for any defects if the consumer is not an IT engineer  so if Linux blows up and data is lost  then the authors are liable       Ciaran Johnson says that M oft and others have similar clauses   the point here is that they are   all   invalid   just that this one affects the GPL also   Niall O Broinn makes the point that it is not a sale  but rather a service leasing arrangement and that s why it doesn t come under this point   I would suggest that the whole thrust of this article has been to see software  sales   even if no money changes hands  as governed very much by consumer law  in France anyway     Rick Moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting of rights which are not default   See the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to be explicitly specified   under French law    The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract        5  Roughly   There may be other reasons under French law why the  GPL may be invalid            Whole Article                Freedom a  is worth more than these imperfect licences    Specialised lawyers look at the GPL     Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky  duly appointed to the court  and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum  both specialised in the area of intellectual property examine the  free  licences and in particular the GPL  They have published their study in the review  Proprietes intellectuelles  Intellectual property   and their conclusion is grim    Their approach is interesting  The problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under French law  for them the question is a moot point  but rather they asked themselves about the form and the content of the text of free licences  and in particular the GPL  The problem is not free programmes  but rather the licence contracts of free programmes     Absence of critical clauses     The authors tell us that first of all  the reference to  copyright  is not legally sufficient in the framework of international contracts   which is the case of licence contracts for programmes developed and spread via the Internet   The idea of copyright can basically include differences from one country to another  This is why  under international contracts  it is necessary to specify to which laws one is referring  French law  American  c     The authors only found three public licences which were correctly formulated on this point  QPL  IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public Licence      Specification in the English language     Next  the authors remind us that  at least in France   no clause in a contract may be contrary to French law   However  it turns out that a licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law in several respects  Firstly  it is written in English and the FSF doesn t officially approve translations   The  Toubon law  obliges this sort of contract to be written in French  including for businesses since the notion of  user  applies not only to consumers  but also to businesses  professionals  c    Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench  lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that  as far as business is concerned  the  Toubon law  is probably doomed to change since it is in contradiction of European directives on the subject  but whatever about that  the problem is still valid for individuals  and while waiting for it  French law  to change  French companies have to deal with it  since it is the law of the land    A programme under the GPL can suddenly change licence    Another problem  much more serious  is that according to French law  the author of a free programme can  at any time  invoke the invalidity of the licence for this software by simply changing the licence    In effect  the law of intellectual property stipulates that the granting of rights by the author is subordinate to the condition that each of these granted rights be the object of a distinct clause in the granting act  i e  the licence  and that the granting of any such rights be delimited with respect to its scope and its grantees  and also with respect to its location  i e  where such rights may be excersised   and duration of any such grants   This is not the case of the GPL nor of other free licences  Briefly  this means that in France  or elsewhere if the author is French  that which is under the GPL could revert to proprietary from one day to the next     The problem of the guarantee  hidden defects     An other very serious flaw is that of the guarantee  The GPL licences and others show that the software is delivered  without guarantee   You are going to immediately reply that commercical programmes carry the same clause in their licence contracts  and this is correct  However  whatever is written in a licence contract  one cannot free oneself from the  guarantee from hidden defects   since it is imposed in the Civil Code  This concept is poorly understood by the layman  it protects the buyer  whoever it may be  individual or business  since it specifies the Civil Code and not consumer protection law  against hidden defects  deliberate or made in good faith by the seller    For example  if one buys a pair of socks in a sale  and the shop has a notice specifying that  Sale items are neither refunded nor exchanged   and on arriving home you notice that one of the socks has a hole in it  several scenarios are possible    You could have checked the socks before purchase  the flaw is deemed  obvious  and you can sing for your money    You couldn t check the socks  they were packaged for example   and in this case  despite the notice  neither refund nor exchange   you may invoke  hidden defect  and have them changed or obtain a refund  it s up to you   Personally  I have already invoked in shops the  hidden defect  clause and it always worked well  shopkeepers are always very cooperative if you quote a couple of words of the Civil Code     The concept of hidden defect is rather wide  it is necessary that you hadn t the possibility of discovering the defect before buying the product and then  according to the Civil Code  that you wouldn t have bought it at that price if you had known about the defect    The third case which is much rarer   is if you are able to show that the vendor had knowledge of the defect  hidden   but didn t inform you  In this case  not only does he have to reimburse the product  but all expenses incurred by the sale  metro tickets to go to the shop  the fuse which blew when you plugged it in  c     This idea of  hidden defect  applies to all products  including programmes  This was made abundantly clear by the authorities  and the courts  surrounding Y2K   This is particularly inconvenient for free programmes  since a site which offers a Linux distro for download is supposed to provide a guarantee against hidden flaws    LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if in the case of a free programme  one could speak about a  hidden  defect since the source code was available  he replied  Actually  concerning the guarantee  the question of obvious defect will arise  This analyis will be different depending on whether the person who downloads the distribution is an IT professional or not    OpenSource has this advantage over the proprietary programme  it protects the distributor against a guarantee of hidden defect insofar as the buy is an IT person  But  for distribution to the public at large  the problem remains the same     Roughly Speaking    Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself  this study is far from being exhaustive and many other areas could be explored   During this interview  we asked ourselves  for example  about the fragility of the GPL clause which forbids linking source code under the GPL with proprietary code   In effect  the laws of intellectual property give the right to the user to modify a programme with the intention of permitting interoperability with another programme  If for that  I need to link with a proprietary library  communication protocol  device driver  I may consider as  null and void  this clause of the GPL    The conclusion of this study is a wake up call for the community   Freedom  merits more than these shoddy licences  which should be modified before court cases over them proliferate and put at risk the undeniable originality of this effort                                   Une publication de l Institut de recherche en propri t  intellectuelle  No4 Juillet 2002   Une telle clause de

      " On Mon  2002 10 07 at 12 48  Owen Byrne wrote    I suppose Canada  which is supposed to be a  loose confederation  of 2   founding nations  French and English  can be cited as a success  The   jury is still out  but so far only a few brief rebellions and   referendums and such  still together after 130  years    Alberta  and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces  is definitely not happy with the current arrangement   Some of this has to do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured   When I was last up in Alberta  a month ago   the newspapers were reporting something like 70  of Albertans favor separating from Canada  and over several distinct issues   The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces  their interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in Ottawa   While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian  they only have token representation in the federal government   While I m not clear on exactly how the government works up there  representation is not entirely based on population  and it works out that some eastern provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire province of Alberta   The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so much as throwing Alberta a bone  and are able to do so because even the sparsely populated eastern provinces can out vote Alberta despite having fewer people   Or something like that   The Canadian government is less restricted than the US government  so they can do strange things  like having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces  Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities   It is essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the inter mountain West of the US   Unlike the US case though  the rest of Canada would really be hurting if they weren t receiving all those tax dollars from Alberta   OTOH  Alberta would probably thrive   I have friends in Alberta  and visit occasionally  but I m not totally clear on everything that goes on in that country  due to my partial unfamiliarity with how the government works up there  so I m a little fuzzy on some of the details   What I do know is that on average the Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and the sentiment has been getting worse over the years   Cheers    James Rogers jamesr best com   \n",

the wcarriers networks   anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad  low quality  small in size  but kids totally dug that stuff  seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point  and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs  i don t think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography   developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc  i think it expands the market and forms a new category  the extent of the category size is the big question  will it be a fad or will it a sustained market   that s consumer behavior and marketing  but i don t think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market  in this case  digital photos or normal photos   europe s the one to watch   more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right  they ll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them    h   From   Rob Shavell

as rain on pricing    i am  mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting     my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways  once there are a billion  eye s  which can instantly share what they see  amongst each other   that doesn t mean that people will stop talking on  their phones  or that people will spend more time w images than voice   just  that it is fundamental   from news to crime to privacy to dating to family  life to bloopers and practical jokes  i believe there will be an explosion  of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of  their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of  photography by orders of magnitude and in short order  and yes  changes  things  big time

business persons mistake  the content is the users   communications   its anything and everything   avg person could easily send   half dozen pics to a dozen people a day   mainly humorous i d guess  who   cares if content is trivial in nature  picture speaks a thousand words     This does nothing to answer my question   I  do  care about content   Hell   if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth  all day  I d have a different opinion of this   I just am not convinced  that they will  stupid or not      While a picture may be worth a thousand words  and this is the same  argument the guy who works for me made   how many people do you know who  communicate by pictures   Sure  it sounds nice to say that a picture is  such an efficient messaging mechanism  but how often do you actually find  yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something     I don t buy it     For most messages  text works fine and is the most efficient  mechanism   For some messages  pictures do the job  but I would say not  nearly as often as words   Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and  such are games   Because images are usually not the most efficient way to  get a message across      misc ramblings  i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same   thing about  1 hour photo  processing   trivial  who needs it  i get better   resultion elswhere   and yet  it had great decentralizing impact   the  plant   had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation   the digital  camera    and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of   decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion  which will put the   photo giants to bed  and change the world in a meaningful way   also  SMS   didn t take off because its easy  it took off because it costs less   its   greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the  profitabilty  of their SMS   traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth   in reality    SMS cannibilizes the voice rev s they bought their networks to handle     Again  this is the same argument my colleague made  along with  you just  don t understand kids today  and they ll run with this     I wasn t saying  that MMS wouldn t take off because it wasn t high quality or that it wasn t  easy   I was saying that I couldn t see why people would use it in a way  that  changed the face of communications      I m looking for the compelling reason  even if it s a stupid one  why  people would want to do this   Sure  if they integrate cameras into the  phone  and the quality improves  even only marginally  I can certainly see  people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to  other people   But  mostly  I don t see what the benefit is to this over  sending them to someone s email address  or putting together an online  or  offline  photoalbum     I don t think 1 hour photos are trivial   People want to see their own pics  right away  and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots   That s  one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on   The instant  view part   I m guessing your argument is that people not only want   instant view   but also  instant show    Which is what this service  offers   I m not convinced that most people want  instant show    I think  people like to package their pictures and show them   That s why people put  together fancy albums  and sit there and force you to go through them while  they explain every picture   Sure  occasionally  instant show  is nice  but  it s just  nice  on occasion   I still can t see how it becomes a integral  messaging method     What s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it  from one phone to another   There has to be  some  benefit  even if it s  silly if people are going to flock to it     I m searching    no one has given me a straight answer yet     The  only  really intriguing idea I ve heard about things like MMS lately  are Dan Gillmor s assertion that one day in the near future some news event  will happen  and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile  phones  from all different angles  and those photos tell the real story of  what happened   before the press even gets there     Willing to be proven wrong   Mike    PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as  they currently are  then MMS is  never  going to catch on   \n",

      " Well  for one  it would free up the similar laptop I already got to just run Amithlon  or if that wasn t so fun  bsd  to run just OpenBSD   This is a near term thing I could look forward to   However  an  official  laptop seems unexciting to me with only the items mentioned   Most important are the particulars distinguishing the listed spec from a Dell 2650  preferably  1  GeForce4 440 Go or newer  pleasingly modern GPU  the GeForce2Go  with 16MB video RAM  too little  I have is not so much too slow as inefficient  with factory settings it would actually crash from running too hot and too fast   Accelerating the Ami  and possibly OpenUAE graphics is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments  but an energy efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and portability  read  battery lifetime  enabler    1 5  Great control over CPU state  by use of  internet keys  wired to BIOS bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll wheel   Also  hibernate that works  please   1 7  Bootable to USB 2 0 drives  e g  larger external ones  in BIOS  please   2  P4 Dells overheat   They have a big heatsink and a little fan to pull air through it  and if you don t elevate thelaptop off the desk or table or bed it s on  the fan will  stay  on   Not good for MTBS  mean time between service  unless you ve got an angle on making money on service from Amigans       One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs behind the AMLCD  thus using the backside of the display half as a radiator   though it interferes with the case notion below    yes  Aavid or such makes some as a standard part   I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative mass in elevating the laptop  i e  in the form of a catch handle and second logo device behind the laptop  which generally provides stow and attachment for elevation legs  move them out farther to get to the next higher ekevation  until the sides of the laptop are met    This also happens to provide a little protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep plugged in all the time  a bit longer port life  Please    3  A case color other than brown or black  and preferably  if the display module NRE is entirely permissive  the capability to  run with the backlight off    Again  to save battery power  but also as a feature  maybe you remember the iBooks modified in this manner   The user has the privilege to pull out the backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe CF assembly  with its backreflector  and the whole warrantee   This provides for excellent outdoor use  often with the diffuser reinserted to keep depth of field distractions minimised  What would I like   A1200 putty color  any translucency  in or over a rosewood colored  in KDE color browser  I see chocolate  firebrick and a couple of  indian red  that are great candidates  base  I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight without closing the lid  and to be  able  to fit an  external  light source such as a UV filtered solar collector  and glare hood  to feed into the backlight   Not only does this make an excellent color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably  The logo should be a coloration of a minimal surface  as the MAA is trying to get me to renew with   demos at  at first blush   We ll see what comes out of the contest and maybe you ll like the mapping MathCAD does of the logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the openness of AmigaOS  Ami  and Amiga community  MAA org has more references  I m sure   4  Obviously Elfin details   e g  the backlight inlet   Other details  USB2 x preferred  FireWire would be needed if that s unavailable  Options like 802 11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port should round out the offering   An option for just released  13 micron P4  with mobile power features  could make more reviewers greenlight the series  much better power consumption  and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that  CompactFlash  SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card interfaces would be very pleasant   I ve mentioned booting to USB  and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also  To that end  a backup solution with compression using USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice bundle item  that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS        Blue skies  and clear water and fresh

      "   Hamza s horrid   but we must tolerate him  Rod Liddle Wednesday August 28  2002 The Guardian  Sheikh Abu Hamza al Masri  our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies  spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in Victoria Park  Hackney  I ve often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays  Head for the beach and maybe swing by B Q on the way home  I had hoped  I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the sea  an ice cream cone in his one good hand  the waves tickling his shins  and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once  instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and maybe me and you  too  But B Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza s budget since the Bank of England froze his assets  so Victoria Park had to do  But he sounded happy enough when I spoke to him  with the babble of tiny  cheerful  Islamic proto warriors in the background  You must know Hamza  he s the imam designed  it would seem  by the Daily Mail s cartoonist Mac  Large metal hook in place of a left hand  One eye covered by a patch  the other a baleful  watchful  milky white  We don t mock the disabled any more these days  unless it s someone like Hamza whom we don t like  then  if you ll excuse the inapt phraseology  the gloves come off  So Hamza is known  with that vaulting imagination typical of the British right  as  Captain Hook   in articles which usually call for his arrest  or extradition to the US  or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe off to Pakistan or Afghanistan  where he fought the Russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities   anywhere  really  just out of here  And if we can t lock him up or chuck him out of the country  maybe we can force him to shut up  Because we don t like Hamza very much  We weren t that fond of him before September 11  but afterwards  in that nervy  paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in  our disapprobation turned into political persecution  And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they ve got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner  urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam  All out of context  and a very long time ago  says the imam  not unduly bothered  But perhaps he should be  because our reputation for broad mindedness and tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror s scoop  Hamza preaches  or preached  at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque   so  earlier this year  the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks  I didn t know Charity Commissioners were meant to do stuff like that  He has had his passport seized and not returned  his assets have been frozen  He is tailed by the police every now and then  and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press  And this last point is because  we tell ourselves  endlessly   repeating the mantra over and over again  and fervently wishing it to be true   Hamza is not  representative  of British Muslims  as if British Muslims were a simple  homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation  And perhaps succour  The trouble is  in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more  representative  than the list of those government approved Muslim spokesmen who were   uncomfortably  I suspect   dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban  An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4 s Today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush s crusade  One in six were  to put it mildly  ambivalent about the attack on the US  the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally   A large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against Islam  Which is what Hamza said  repeatedly  But it was something that  at the time  we didn t want to hear  Now  if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across   superficially  at least   as someone from the liberal left  No war against Iraq  Britain to become independent of US foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states  stronger action against Israel  mistrust of global capitalism  redistribution of wealth  Nor is he particularly anti semitic  so far as I can tell  although I don t suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year  In yesterday s Guardian  the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful for the sheikh s message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked  Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented  he is  without question  rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public  His ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam  he would be happy  in a truly Islamic society  to stone women to death for adultery  for example  You and I would find many   perhaps most   of his views utterly repellent  And that s the point  Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural  Multiculturalism is not  surely  the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony  That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism  Multiculturalism is  rather  the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture   and maybe learn from them  The FBI has been investigating Hamza  but  of course  has found nothing remotely incriminating  The real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views  It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally  This is a perfectly noble argument  but it does not wash  You don t defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn t exist  And if British Muslims   maybe a minority  maybe not   feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy  it is not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza  Shutting the man up  therefore  won t make a difference  It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it  The glass is falling hour by hour  the glass will fall for ever  But if you break the bloody glass  you won t hold up the weather                             Yahoo  Groups Sponsor                           4 DVDs Free  s p Join Now

      "   Bottom line  the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have   endorsed the meaning behind the phrase  but it is questionable that he   ever coined it   An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report  there s no written evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the infamous quote attributed to him  It s kind of astounding that there is enough general social consensus  25  of all queries makes it a  very  FAQ  and  eyewitness  reporting without a single written source  What the essay below doesn t seem to answer  though  is what the earliest attributed quote in print by any other writer is  I d naturally be much more skeptical if the  quote  emerged after his death    RK                                                                     A billion here  a billion there         Did Dirksen ever say    A billion here  a billion there  and pretty soon you re talking real money    or anything very close to that    Perhaps not  Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio records of The Dirksen Congressional Center  staffers there have found no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to him   Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote or its variations   Here is what they examined  all of the existing audio tapes of the famed  Ev and Charlie  and  Ev and Jerry  shows  all newspapers clippings in the Dirksen Papers  about 12 500 pages of Dirksen s own speech notes  transcripts of his speeches and media appearances  transcripts of Republican leadership press conferences  and Dirksen s statements on the Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record   Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech  preferring to rely on notes  he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular turn of phrase  For example  in referring to the public debt or excessive government spending  Dirksen would jot the word  pothole  to remind him to tell the following story  on this occasion in reference to the debt ceiling     As I think of this bill  and the fact that the more progress we make the deeper we go into the hole  I am reminded of a group of men who were working on a street  They had dug quite a number of holes  When they got through  they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to the hole  and they had a nice little mound  which was quite a traffic hazard    Not knowing what to do with it  they sat down on the curb and had a conference  After a while  one of the fellows snapped his fingers and said   I have it  I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth and remove the hazard  We will just dig the hole deeper        On the same occasion  Dirksen relied on yet another  spending  story  one he labeled  cat in the well      One time in the House of Representatives  told me a story about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy  He said   Johnny  a cat fell in a well 100 feet deep  Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and then fell back 2 feet  How long would it take the cat to get out of the well     Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a while  and then when the teacher came down and said   How are you getting along   Johnny said   Teacher  if you give me another slate and a couple of slate pencils  I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes I can land that cat in hell     If some people get any cheer our of a  328 billion debt ceiling  I do not find much to cheer about concerning it       But there are no such reminders for the  A billion here  a billion there         tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen s note making tendencies  He spoke often and passionately about the debt ceiling  federal spending  and the growth of government  Yet there is no authoritative reference to the  billion  phrase   The chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from people who claim to have heard him  The Library of Congress  for example  cites someone s personal observation on the campaign trail as evidence  The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard Dirksen say those words  some even providing the date of the event  But cross checking that information with the records has  so far  turned up nothing in the way of confirmation   The closest documented statement came at a joint Senate House Republican leadership press conference on March 8  1962  when Dirksen said   The favorite sum of money is  1 billion   a billion a year for a fatter federal payroll  a billion here  a billion there    But the  and pretty soon you re talking real money  is missing   In another close call  the New York Times  January 23  1961  quoted Dirksen   Look at education   two and one half billion   a billion for this  a billion for that  a billion for something else  Three to five billion for public works  You haven t got any budget balance left  You ll be deeply in the red     Of course  the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late Senator s comments  For example  The Center that bears his name does not have his testimony before committees  Their collection of Congressional Records ends in 1965  omitting the last four years of Dirksen s life and career   he might have employed the phrase only late  although witnesses claim he said it throughout his career  Dirksen s campaign speeches tended not to produce transcripts  only sketchy notes or abbreviated newspaper accounts  Dirksen also held center stage before the video age  meaning that many remarks  particularly those in campaigns  escaped capture   Bottom line  the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have endorsed the meaning behind the phrase  but it is questionable that he ever coined it          My permanent email address is khare alumni caltech edu  \n",

this direction  as I am forced to use Windows during the day  I say half hearted because I m still application centric  and I don t go as far with keyboard shortcuts as I could  But I don t use the desktop at all  never have  on any system   and I don t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I personally find them awkward  YMMV   If you must use Windows  the first step towards a productive system is managing your Start menu   I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs   0 Control Panel    1 Mozilla    2 Emacs    3 DOS home    4 DOS work    5 DOS incoming   each of which gives me a command line  but in different directories    7 Python    9 IE   Also    Explorer home      Explorer work      Explorer incoming   which open Explorer windows in various useful directories  the same directories as the DOS shortcuts  only with the shift key held down  and yes  I intentionally set it up so that   went to my work folder   Less used programs are taken out of their useless submenus  as installed  and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed   Ad aware    Excel    IM    Netscape 4    Paint Shop Pro    Query Tool  ODBC     VMWare    Word   All other submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu   Yes  delete  Accessories   Do you honestly ever use it  If so  it s probably a sign of a larger productivity problem   Things which never need to be run manually  like WinZip and Quicktime  are removed from the Programs menu  Maintaining a clean Programs menu is an ongoing struggle  but well worth it   On most modern keyboards  there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu  which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys  Otherwise ctrl esc always works  Menu 4 gives me a new command prompt in my work directory  Menu P N runs Netscape 4  for compatibility testing in my day job  ugh   Mozilla and Emacs are almost always open  but I quit lesser used applications as soon as I m done using them  mostly because my laptop doesn t have a lot of memory    I install Cygwin so that the command line is actually useful  Cygwin is a collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities  including mv  cp  scp  ssh  man  tar  less  grep  patch  ncftp  cvs  and many others  And bash  which I don t use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames  I also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 120 x 50  almost full screen at 1024 x 768   and screen buffer size to 120 x 3000  Set window position at 0 x 0  and don t let the system position the window   In Mozilla  I set my home page to  about blank   set Internet Search to search with Google  use Tabbed Browsing  open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases  always show the tab bar  and load links in the background  essential for weblog surfing  you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background   Under Scripts   Plugins  I do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows  I turn off the sidebar  turn on the Site Navigation Bar  delete all pre installed bookmarks  and create two bookmarks  one which takes me to my webmail  and another which takes me to my internal site search  from which I can find all other bookmarks I need   In Internet Explorer  I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog  since that s the only thing I do in Internet Explorer  alt tab back and forth between Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup pgdown between tabs within Mozilla  since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs  making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible   I use Emacs locally and vi remotely  because the default behavior of Emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable   For instance  editing a CGI script named foo cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo cgi  backup file  which is world readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks  Try this sometime on your favorite web site   Among other things  my  emacs file  which is actually called  emacs on Windows  instructs Emacs to store all backup files in a single directory  d \\backup   to treat all XML files as DocBook  all CGI scripts as Python  and all SQL scripts as PL SQL  to use Cygwin s bash shell for M x shell  to use a single maximized frame with no menubar  titled as the name of the current file  to show column numbers  to accept  y  and  n  for yes no questions  not to blink  not to beep  and to close the current file when I press M w  I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad exe to get all text files to open in Emacs   I got this idea from Ultraedit   My  emacs file is my second most backed up possession   I don t use Windows  useless directory structure for user home directories  On my D drive I have d \\home  contains directories for my books and other personal projects  each under CVS control  8212 also set as my home directory using the HOME environment variable   d \\work  contains directories for each work project  also under CVS   d \\incoming  set as default download directory for all programs that download things   and d \\backup  used by Emacs  and for temporary storage  for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created CVS projects   I don t know or care what s where on my C drive   I have tried many  many address books  and still store all my contacts  email addresses  snail mail addresses  phone numbers  and other vital personal information in a text file called phone  stored in d \\home\\phone  It is not in any particular format  other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries  I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses after their name  and use M x occur in Emacs to search by keyword  This file is my single most backed up possession   Other essential free Windows utilities I use  in no particular order   TweakUI

      " I ve seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums for several years   I ve always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason   Here is a recent article from U

animal remains are melting out of glaciers  a bounty of a warming world  BY ALEX MARKELS  As he hiked near Colorado s Continental Divide in the summer of 2001  Ed Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13 000 feet   It looked like a bison skull   the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls   I thought   That s strange  Bison don t live this high up      Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science  where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bison one that died about 340 years ago   This was an extraordinary discovery   says Russ Graham  the museum s chief curator  adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago   There s probably a lot more like it yet to be found    And not just bison  Colorado isn t the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting  Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru to Alaska a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industry have shrunk or thawed many of the world s 70 000 glaciers  As the ice recedes  a treasure trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging  extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze  The fabrics  wood  bone  and DNA rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists  understanding of our predecessors  health  habits  and technology  and the prey they pursued    It s mind boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains   says Johan Reinhard  a high altitude archaeologist and explorer in residence at the National Geographic Society  Rare  spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5 300 year old  Ice Man   found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991  have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information  Now  as the ice continues to retreat  it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains   Vanishing act  The trick is finding such specimens before Mother Nature and looters take them first  Once uncovered  frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals  Moreover  they re often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don t even realize they re ancient   That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in British Columbia  Canada  three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal   It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice   recalls Warren Ward  a teacher from nearby Nelson   But when I looked closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones    Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter  or perhaps a fur trapper  the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip Loc bag and delivered them to local officials  Archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter s body  along with a woven hat  fur clothing  and what seemed to be a medicine bag  Carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago  Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts inchi  or Long Ago Person Found  by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations  who may be his direct descendants   he is perhaps the best preserved human from the period ever found in North America   Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could explain what that long ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place   Before this there was no archaeological record of people living here   says Greg Hare  a Yukon government archaeologist   Now we see that this area was very much part of people s seasonal activities    Like Ward s discovery  the search began by chance  when Kristin Benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband  Gerry Kuzyk  hunted sheep at 6 000 feet in the mountains of the south Yukon  They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung   It was really odd  because I knew there hadn t been caribou in the area for at least 100 years   recalls Kuzyk  then a wildlife biologist with the Yukon government   Caribou cake  Returning a week later  he found  what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it   It turned out to be a 4 300 year old atlatl  or spear thrower  Further investigation of the ice patch and scores of others around the region revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7 800 years of changing hunting practices   Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies  Hunters followed the game  They returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice   We ve got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1 200 years ago   says Hare  who now oversees the research project   Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1 300 years ago  And by 1 200 years ago  there s no more throwing darts    Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck  They are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska s Wrangell and St  Elias mountain ranges the United States  most glaciated terrain and in the Andes  Johan Reinhard thinks the fast  thawing European Alps could also deliver more findings  perhaps as exquisite as the Ice Man   Global warming is providing us high altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now  We re probably about the only ones happy about it      \n",

      " Hindus mourn  monkey god    By Omer Farooq BBC reporter in Hyderabad  Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh    The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed  Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over zealous worshippers   The animal was cremated in Anantapur district  400 kilometres  250 miles  south of the state capital  Hyderabad  on Sunday   It had not eaten for three weeks   Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god  Hanuman   Garlanded  One animal rights activist said his group s efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people    The monkey s death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple  but were prevented by villagers   The monkey  which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month ago  attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages  as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka   Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock    Exploited   Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village  as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents   But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated   They filed a petition in the state s High Court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple   The group also alleged that people s religious feelings were being exploited to make money   The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey   but villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time     \n",

having the kernel compiled by me  I have no kernel source package installed   I ve added a flag  kernsrc   that also can be used   without  to remove the dependency for kernel source at build time   It would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist   lib modules `uname  r` build include linux   h   though  however  I m a beginner in RPM building    is it possible to BuildRequire for a file not provided by a package at all   I ve googled a bit  and found no way to do that   I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the   with cards option in alsa s   configure  but don t know how to do that   Only found out about   without from your first alsa driver spec  and existing RPM docs don t help much    Oh  and one more thing      At first I ve installed the first version of alsa driver for 2 4 18 10  although I don t have that kernel  to supply the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm s  and compiled the modules from source   It created the  dev

      " The Electronic Telegraph  Emigrate to Russia  That s a steppe too far  Filed  28 08 2002    So you think you ve got it bad  fed up with Folkestone  bored with Birmingham or sick of Sheffield   Those 54 per cent of Britons   according to a Daily Telegraph YouGov survey this week   who dream of a stress free life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad   Kommersant  a Russian daily newspaper  yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in Blair s Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial Russia   After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons  its tongue in cheek article admitted  however  that the grass was not always greener on the other side    The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet   said Kommersant    In any central Russian district  life  by British standards  is unseemingly cheap and remarkably laid back  By 11am most of the working population are becoming  traditionally  relaxed    The time for elevenses in Britain   perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate Hobnob   is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour   It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow  It is also opening time in the nation s vodka shops   And the vodka  like all other spirits  is cheap  Kommersant pointed out that  the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their life    The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle of whisky for kopecks    There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a halfpenny in sterling   The whisky is cheap  however  because it is unlike anything the average Briton will have consumed before  It is made of samagon   home distilled  moonshine vodka   coloured with tea  and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among diehard alcoholics   While alcohol is plentiful and cheap  food may not be so easy to come by  The newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs   it selected oxtail soup as an example   were in short supply  However  the wealth of the British settler should overcome the difficulty    For a modest reward in most Russian villages  the locals would happily cut off the tails from the entire collective farm s herd of cattle    One or two potential emigr s might be deterred by language difficulties  There are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the Mongolian border   However  Kommersant pointed out  language difficulties were not considered a deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in which they would like to live   France  the Russian paper claimed  was a country  where English is only known by the beggars  Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists    Despite the low cost of living and the easy going lifestyle  the Russian weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons   Even in the most temperate regions  winter temperatures of  20C are common  And somewhere like the Sakha Republic   east of Siberia and the coldest place in the world   enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures that drop below  70C  Houses are built on concrete stilts because the permafrost makes digging foundations impossible   Again  the Russian paper had a word of reassurance  While acknowledging the climatic problems  it said that  thanks to global warming this difficulty will solve itself    Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia    Thirty three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33 million who leave  We think that the required number could probably be found amongst our citizens    Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians  however  not one of those Britons surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their preferred new home                             Yahoo  Groups Sponsor                           4 DVDs Free  s p Join Now                                                                            To unsubscribe from this group  send an email to  forteana unsubscribe egroups com    Your use of Yahoo  Groups is subject to    \n",

      " This is not directly SpamAssassin related  but more of a general dealing with SPAM issue   What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction  There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the  MAIL FROM  and can deal with at the SMTP level  I have been  and I think most people  respond with a 5 7 1 code  a  permanent  error  That pretty much means   Don t bother to try from that address again  you ll get the same error   People often add cathartic messages to accompany the 550 like   Spammers must die    But this might not be the best way to go  You are telling the spammers that you are on to them  This may cause them to try other methods to get around your blocks  Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail  That is  act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction  but then just drop the mail into the bitbucket   This is generally how SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP transaction has completed successfully   Spammer thinks everything is going fine and has no reason to try new methods   Then there is a third possibility  Instead of returning a 550 code indicating you re on to the spammer  fake a 5 1 1 response which is saying  mailbox does not exist   This would be in the hopes that some spammers out there actually remove names reported as non existent from their lists  I know  a slim hope  but even if only a few do  it can lower the incidence   So  what are the arguments for each  Do spammers even look at  any  of the bounce messages they get  The volume of bounces must be huge  Personally  I m starting to think blackholes are the way to go    But sending back that  Spammer die  die  die   or stock  Access DEE NIED    my ephasis added  message can be pretty satisfying        Crist J  Clark                           cjclark alum mit edu       cjclark jhu edu           cjc freebsd org                                                           In remembrance www osdn com 911                                                  Spamassassin talk mailing list Spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net   \n",

happy or otherwise   however  I resent being lumped in a zero sum zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich and successful at face value is apropos of nothing and I am beginning to understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad hominem  re Cheney  align themselves weird sylogisms like  if rich then deservedly  or  if rich then smarter    Given that  I am also beginning to understand why some people NEED to be rich   WRT to meritocracies   all hail  meritocracies   WRT Harvard  over 90  of 2002 graduates were cum laude    INTERESTING curve   Those

poor to start   with   Actually  if I remember correctly from discussion of the list s composition in Forbes about five or six years ago  the  best  way to get on the Forbes 400 is to have  no  college at all  Can you say  Bootstraps   boys and girls  I knew you could        The  next  category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a  terminal  professional degree  like an MBA  PhD  MD  etc   from the best school possible   Why  Because  as of about 1950  the  best  way to get into Harvard  for instance  is to be  smart   not rich  Don t take my word for it  ask their admissions office  Look at the admissions stats over the years for proof   Meritocracy  American Style  was  invented  at the Ivy League after World War II  Even Stanford got the hint       and  of course  Chicago taught them all how  right       Practically  nobody  who goes to a top 20 American institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days  Unless  of course  their parents  who couldn t afford to go there themselves  got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so  And their kids  still  had to get the grades  and  biased   by intelligence       test scores  to get in    The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with  terminal  degrees  until they actually  own  something and  hire  people  or learn to  make  something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis  persist in the practically insane belief  like life after death  that economics is some kind of zero sum game  that dumb people who don t work hard for it make all the money  and  if someone  is  smart  works hard  and is rich  then they stole their wealth somehow   BTW  none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame  me  for the fact that I m using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders  You were  apparently  too dumb to grab the right end   I  went to Missouri  and  I  don t have a degree in anything actually useful  much less a  terminal  one  which means  I  m broker than anyone on this list    it s just that  you   of all people  lots with educations far surpassing my own  should just plain know better  The facts speak for themselves  if you just open your eyes and  look   There are no epicycles  the universe does not orbit the earth  and economics is not a zero sum game  The cost of anything  including ignorance and destitution  is the forgone alternative  in this case  intelligence and effort       BTW  if we ever actually  had  free markets in this country   including  the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes  all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have  more  money  and there would be  more  self made people on that list  In addition  most of the people who  inherited  money on the list would have  much  less of it  not even relatively speaking  Finally  practically all of that  new  money would have come from economic efficiency and not  stolen  from

For the Designer 2 For the User 5 The Programming Language as Work Environment 6 Acquiring a Sense of Elegance 7 References    The Value of Analogies  Programming language design is a comparatively new activity   it has existed for less than half a century  so it is often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity  Thus  my book Principles of Programming Languages  Design  Evaluation  and Implementation  grew out of a study of teaching methods in architecture  primarily  but also of pedagogy in other disciplines  such as aircraft design  Perhaps you have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars  FORTRAN   Model T  C   dune buggy  etc     These analogies can be very informative  and can serve as ``intuition pumps   to enhance our creativity  but they cannot be used uncritically because they are  in the end  just analogies  Ultimately our design decisions must be based on more than analogies  since analogies can be misleading as well as informative   In this essay I ll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design  but I will base my remarks on a book about structural engineering  The Tower and the Bridge  by David P  Billington  Although there are many differences between bridges and programming languages  we will find that many ideas and insights transfer rather directly   According to Billington  there are three values common to many technological activities  which we can call ``the three E s    Efficiency  Economy and Elegance  These values correspond to three dimensions of technology  which Billington calls the scientific  social and symbolic dimensions  the three S s   We will consider each in turn    Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used  In structural engineering  efficiency deals with the amount of material used  the basic criterion is safety and the issues are scientific  strength of materials  disposition of forces  etc    Similarly  in programming language design  efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources  There are many examples where efficiency considerations influenced programming language design  some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming Languages   In the early days  the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing time  although compile time resource utilization was also relevant  In other cases the resource economized was programmer typing time  and there are well known cases in which this compromised safety  e g  FORTRAN s implicit declarations   There are also many well known cases in which security  i e  safety  was sacrificed for the sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking  e g  array bounds checking    Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time  but we must be careful that we are not comparing apples and oranges  Compile time is not interchangeable run time  and neither one is the same as programmer time  Similarly  computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are reduced to a common denominator  such as money  but this brings in economic considerations  to which we now turn    Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost  Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue  economy is a social issue  In structural engineering  economy seeks to maximize social benefit compared to its cost   This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges are usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public   In programming language design  the ``public   that must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these programmers work   Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict  For example  the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost of computer time compared to programmer time  the shift from the second to the third generation involved the increasing cost of residual bugs in programs  and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of program maintenance compared to program development   Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include  whether major manufacturers support the language  whether prestigious universities teach it  whether it is approved in some way by influential organizations  such as the US Department of Defense   whether it has been standardized  whether it comes to be perceived as a ``real   language  used by ``real programmers    or as a ``toy   language  used by novices or dilettantes   and so forth  As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles  social factors are frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming language   Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money  but the monetary values of costs and benefits are often unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces  Also  many social issues  from dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures  are inaccurately represented by the single dimension of monetary cost  All kinds of ``cost   and ``benefit   must be considered in seeking an economical design    Elegance Symbolizes Good Design  ``Elegance  Who cares about elegance    snorts the hard nosed engineer  but Billington shows clearly the critical role of elegance in ``hard nosed   engineering   For the Designer  It is well known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the difficulty of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language  see my Principles for examples   Structural engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity  but Billington observes that the best designers don t make extensive use of computer models and calculation   One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete  The engineer must make a decision about which variables are significant and which are not  and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this decision is not made well  Also  equations are often simplified  e g   made linear  to make their analysis feasible  and this is another potential source of error  Because of these limitations  engineers that depend on mathematical analysis may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis  Thus the price of safety is additional material and increased cost  i e  decreased efficiency and economy    Similarly in programming language design  the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a choice between an under engineered design  in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions  and an over engineered design  in which we have confidence  but which is inefficient or uneconomical   Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four month old Tacoma Narrows bridge  it vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design  Billington explains that this accident  along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures  was a consequence of an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s  However  the very problem that destroyed the Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided by aesthetic principles   According to Billington  the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis  although they do not abandon it altogether   Rather  their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance  This is because solutions to structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined  that is  there are many possible solutions to a particular problem  such as bridging a particular river  Therefore  expert designers restrict their attention to designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see  The design looks unbalanced if the forces are unbalanced  and the design looks stable if it is stable   The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good  and therefore the design process can be guided by aesthetics without extensive  but incomplete  mathematical analysis  Billington expresses this idea by inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that  in structural design  function follows form  He adds  p  21   ``When the form is well chosen  its analysis becomes astoundingly simple    In other words  the choice of form is open and free  so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design  i e  efficient and economical design   If we do so  then we can let aesthetics guide design   The same applies to programming language design  By restricting our attention to designs in which the interaction of features is manifest   in which good interactions look good  and bad interactions look bad   we can let our aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design  without having to check all the possible interactions   For the User  In this case  what s good for the designer also is good for the user  Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge that looks like it will collapse at any moment  and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which features may ``explode   if combined in the wrong way  The manifest balance of forces in a well designed bridge gives us confidence when we cross it  So also  the manifestly good design of our programming language should reinforce our confidence when we program in it  because we have  well justified  confidence in the consequences of our actions   We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade  When the bridge is unable to sustain the load for which it was designed  and collapses  it won t much matter that it was beautiful on the outside  So also in programming languages  If the elegance is only superficial  that is  if it is not the manifestation of a deep coherence in the design  then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their  unwarranted  confidence   In summary  good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good  As a consequence  these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense  as can the users of the structures  bridges or programming languages  they design  We may miss out on some good designs this way  but they are of limited value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs  We may summarize the preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages  The Elegance Principle  Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good     The Programming Language as Work Environment  There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well engineered programming language  The programming language is something the professional programmer will live with   even live in  It should feel comfortable and safe  like a well designed home or office  in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that take place within it  Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop   A programming language should be a joy to use  This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer s fatigue and frustration  The programming language should not be a hindrance  but should serve more as a collaborator  encouraging programmers to do their jobs better  As some automobiles are ``driving machines   and work as a natural extension of the driver  so a programming language should be a ``programming machine   by encouraging the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso  The programming language should invite the programmer to design elegant  efficient and economical programs   Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values  For example  in the variety of its features it may symbolize profligate excess  sparing economy or asceticism  the kind of its features may represent intellectual sophistication  down to earth practicality or ignorant crudeness  Thus a programming language can promote a set of values  By embodying certain values  it encourages us to think about them  by neglecting or negating other values  it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention  Out of sight  out of mind    Acquiring a Sense of Elegance  Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach  so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined sense of elegance necessary to good design  Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive experience in design  which  especially in Europe  is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers  Because of it  structural engineers design many more bridges than they build  and they learn from each competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers  The public also critiques the competing designs  and in this way becomes more educated  their sense of elegance develops along with that of the designers   So also  to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages   design obsessively   and criticize  revise and discard your designs  You should also evaluate and criticize other people s designs and try to improve them  In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing   comes along    References  1 Billington  David P   The Tower and the

      " Hi Kragen   This is an interesting analysis   I think that there are a couple of nits I might pick  for example  I don t expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while   I think that the most important issue  which is that end users won t be able to fix their systems  is almost passed over   I know that you know this  and you allude to it  but your essay is getting passed around  so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others   There s one other point which you don t make  which I think is very important  which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can t happen without libraries of available vulnerability code   I can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped  uninvited  about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites   Doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples  in the open  that you can define a set  and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure  we wouldn t have Stackguard  ITS4  Nissus  or

00 24 54  0400  EDT    From  Kragen Sitaker  kragen pobox com    To  fork spamassassin taint org   Subject  the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards     On August 7th  an entity known as  iDEFENSE  sent out an announcement    which is appended to this email   Briefly   iDEFENSE   which bills   itself as  a global security intelligence company   is offering cash   for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software   that are not publicly known  especially if you promise not to tell   anyone else      If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue  it will pose a   very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure      At the moment  the dominant paradigm for computer security research   known as  full disclosure   people who discover security   vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them  and a short   while later     after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem       they publish the information  including code to exploit the   vulnerability  if possible      This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by   CERT in the late 1980s  which its proponents might call  responsible   disclosure      never release working exploit code  and never release   any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released   a patch   This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers   vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked   on features  and often  even after the patches were released  people   wouldn t apply them because they didn t know how serious the problem   was      The underground computer criminal community would often discover and   exploit these same holes for months or years while the  responsible   disclosure  process kept their victims  who had no connections in the   underground  vulnerable      The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known   are much less dangerous  because their victims can take steps to   reduce their potential impact     including disabling software    turning off vulnerable features  filtering traffic in transit  and   detecting and responding to intrusions   They are therefore much less   useful to would be intruders   Also  software companies usually see   security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems  and so   prefer to delay publication  and the expense of fixing the bugs  as   long as possible      iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous   than either of the two previous paradigms   They want to be a buyer in   a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information  rewarding   discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash      Not long before  Snosoft  a group of security researchers evidently   including some criminal elements  apparently made an offer to sell the   secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software   vendor  specifically  they apparently made a private offer to   Hewlett Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP s Tru64 Unix secret if   HP retained Snosoft s  consulting services    HP considered this   extortion and responded with legal threats  and Snosoft published the   information      If this is allowed to happen  it will cause two problems which    together  add up to a catastrophe      First  secret software vulnerability information will be available to   the highest bidder  and to nobody else   For reasons explained later    I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime   syndicates  although that will not be obvious to the sellers      Second  finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will   become lucrative for many more talented people   The result will be       just as in the  responsible disclosure  days     that the good   guys will remain vulnerable for months and years  while the majority   of current vulnerabilities are kept secret      I ve heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the   vendors of the vulnerable software  but I don t think that s   plausible   If someone can steal  20 000 because a software bug lets   them  the software vendor is never held liable  often  in fact  the   people who administer the software aren t liable  either     when   credit card data are stolen from an e commerce site  for example    Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web site   administrator some time  and it might save the software vendor some   negative PR  but it can net the thief thousands of dollars      I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability   information is most lucrative     the thieves who can use it to   execute the largest heists without getting caught   Inevitably  that   means organized crime syndicates  although the particular gangs who   are good at networked theft may not yet exist      There might be the occasional case where a market leader  such as   Microsoft  could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR   than a gang could make by theft   Think of a remote root hole in   Samba  for example      Right now  people who know how to find security exploits are either   motivated by personal interest in the subject  motivated by the public   interest  motivated by a desire for individual recognition  or   personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits   Creating   a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly   increase the availability of that information to the people who can   afford to pay the most for it  spies  terrorists  and organized crime      Let s not let that happen            This is the original iDEFENSE announcement      From  Sunil James    Sent  Wednesday  August 07  2002 12 32 PM   Subject  Introducing iDEFENSE s Vulnerability Contributor Program       Greetings      iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability   Contributor Program  VCP   The VCP pays contributors for the advance   notification of vulnerabilities  exploit code and malicious code      iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP  The following   provides answers to some basic questions about the program      Q  How will it work    A  iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish   security research for compensation  rather  it could be for any of a number   of motivations  including the following                 Pure love of security research              The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks              The desire to urge vendors to fix their products              The publicity that often accompanies disclosure     The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the   Internet community  but who would also like to be paid for doing the   work The compensation will depend  among other things  on the following   items                 The kind of information being shared  i e  vulnerability or exploit               The amount of detail and analysis provided              The potential severity level for the information shared              The types of applications  operating systems  and other              software and hardware potentially affected              Verification by iDEFENSE Labs              The level of exclusivity  if any  for data granted to iDEFENSE     Q  Who should contribute to the VCP    A  The VCP is open to any individual  security research group or other   entity      Q  Why are you launching this program    A  Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence  Contributions   to some lists take time before publication to the public at large  More   often  many of these services charge clients for access without paying the   original contributor  Under the iDEFENSE program  the contributor is   compensated  iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue  and iDEFENSE clients and the   public at large are warned in a timely manner      Q  Who gets the credit    A  The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or   exploit information      Q  When can I contribute    The VCP is active  You are welcome to begin contributing today      To learn more  go to  If you have   questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP  please   contact us at contributor idefense

      " I got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of his reign at the FCC   He said they were going to take a real hands off approach  so it s funny that they would blame the regulators for causing the collapse   One thing he did get right  is that he wasn t worried that the US was behind Europe in the wireless licensing spectrum   This is something very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for very little benefit   His legacy was is supposed to be rethinking the FCC s role to stay out of the way in this period of business innovation in the wireless space as he didn t want the government forcing business models onto the private sector   His full transcript is here    Interestingly enough I got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole CTIA 2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers   Clay and I hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo support for Craig Barrett    His message was that there s no difference between wired and wireless Internet  it s all the same thing  Instead of scalable networks  we should be thinking about scalable content    using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with the content scaling back for each target platform    The best part of the whole trip wasn t hobnobbing at all  but really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms  They decided to put us up in one of their  10 000 night high roller rooms   They put Clay in one and me in another  The Venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms anywhere  but these ones were bigger than my whole house  8    Greg        Rohit Khare wrote    I can t believe I actually read a laugh out loud funny profile of the    FCC Commissioner  fer crissakes  So the following article comes   recommended  a fine explanation of Michael Powell s extraordinary   equivocation      On the other hand  I can also agree with Werbach s Werblog entry    Rohit      A Trip to F C C  World       Nicholas Lemann has a piece in the New Yorker this week about FCC    Chairman Michael Powell   It s one of the first articles I ve seen    that captures some of Powell s real personality  and the way he s    viewed in Washington   Unfortunately  Lemann ends by endorsing    conventional political wisdom   After describing how Powell isn t    really a fire breathing ideological conservative  he concludes that     in essence  Powell favors the inumbent local Bell telephone companies     while a Democratic FCC would favor new entrants   I know that s not    how Powell sees the world  and though I disagree with him on many    issues  I think he s right to resist the old dichotomy        The telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who    went through it   The disaster wasn t the regulators  fault  as some    conservatives argue   But something clearly went horribly wrong  and    policy makers should learn from that experience   Contrary to Lemann s    speculation  the upstart carriers won t be successful in a Gore    administration  because it s too late   Virtually all of them are    dead  and Wall Street has turned off the capital tap for the    foreseeable future   Some may survive  but as small players rather    than world dominators        The battle between CLECs and RBOCs that Lemann so astutely parodies is    old news   The next important battle in telecom will be between those    who want to stay within the traditional boxes  and those who use    different models entirely   That s why open broadband networks and    open spectrum are so important   Whatever the regulatory environment     there is going to be consolidation in telecom   Those left out in that    consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into    the home  or slowly die  The victors in the consolidation game will    cut back on innovation and raise prices  which will create further    pressure for alternatives        Lemann is right that policy making looks much drier and more ambiguous    on the ground than through the lens of history   But he s wrong in    thinking that telecom s future will be something like its past        Friday  October 04  2002    11 17 11 AM  comments  0                                                                              THE CHAIRMAN   by NICHOLAS LEMANN   He s the other Powell  and no one is sure what he s up to    New Yorker  October 8  2002     Last year  my middle son  in eighth grade and encountering his first   fairly serious American history course  indignantly reported that the   whole subject was incomprehensible  I was shocked  What about Gettysburg   and the Declaration of Independence and the Selma to Montgomery march    Just look at my textbook  he said  and when I did I saw his point  His   class had got up to the eighteen forties  What I expected was a big   beefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks  and  in deed    there was some of that  But the main difference between my son s text   and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous   decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American   history  There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and   reciprocal trade agreements  I skipped ahead  past the Civil War  hoping   for easier going  only to encounter currency floats and the regulation   of freight rates  Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it   become possible to see the federal government s main function as   responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice    instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests      Even now  if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty   speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington  what you d find   is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage  not so   much over the public as over each other  agribusiness versus real   estate  banks versus insurance companies  and so on  The arena in which   this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and   commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them  It s   an insider s game  less because the players are secretive than because   the public and the press encouraged by the players  who speak in jargon    can t get themselves interested      One corner of Washington might be called F C C  World  for the Federal   Communications Commission  F C C  World has perhaps five thousand   denizens  They work at the commission itself  at the House and Senate   commerce committees  and at the Washington offices of the companies that   the commission regulates  They read Communications Daily  subscription   price   3 695 a year   and every year around Christmastime they   grumblingly attend the Chairman s Dinner  at a Washington hotel  where   the high point of the evening is a scripted  supposedly self deprecating   comedy routine by the commission s chairman      Of all the federal agencies and commissions  the F C C  is the one that   Americans ought to be most interested in  after all  it is involved with   a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the   American economy  as well as important aspects of daily life telephone   and television and radio and newspapers and the Internet  And right now   F C C  World is in  if not a crisis  at least a very soapy lather    because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the    corporate scandals  concerns the economic collapse of companies   regulated by the F C C  Qwest  WorldCom  Adelphia  and Global Crossing    among others  are  or were  part of F C C  World  AOL Time Warner is   part of F C C  World  Jack Grubman  the former Salomon Smith Barney   analyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay  of Enron  as the   embodiment of the corporate scandals  is part of F C C  World  In the   past two years  companies belonging to F C C  World have lost trillions   of dollars in stock market valuation  and have collectively served as a   dead weight pulling down the entire stock market      This year  an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state   of the F C C  has been circulating widely within F C C  World  It evokes   F C C  World s feverish mood   The F C C  is fiddling while Rome burns     and suggests why nobody besides residents of F C C  World has thought of   the commission in connection with the corporate scandals  The sentence I   just quoted is followed by this explanation   The ILECs appear likely to   enter all l d  markets within twelve months  while losing virtually no   residential customers to attackers since 1996  and suffering about 10    market share loss in business lines to CLECs   It s a lot easier to   think about evil C E O s than to decipher that        Even in good times  F C C  World pays obsessive attention to the   commission s chairman  In bad times  the attention becomes especially   intense  and when the chairman is a celebrity F C C  World devotes   itself to full time chairman watching  The current chairman  Michael   Powell  is a celebrity  at least by government official standards    because he is the only son of Colin Powell  the Secretary of State    Unlike his father  he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity  which   generates enormous  and at times apoplectically toned  speculation about   who he really is and what he s really up to  Powell is young to be the   head of a federal agency he is thirty nine and genially charming    Everybody likes him  Before becoming chairman  he was for three years   one of the F C C  s five commissioners  not only is he fluent in the   F C C  s incomprehensible patois  he has a Clintonesque love of the   arcane details of communications policy  He s always saying that he s an    avid moderate   And yet he has a rage inciting quality  One of his   predecessors as chairman  Reed Hundt  quoted in Forbes  compared Powell   to Herbert Hoover  Mark Cooper  of the Consumer Federation of America    calls him  radical and extreme   Just as often as he s accused of being   a right wing ideologue  Powell gets accused of being paralytically   cautious   It ain t about singing  Kum Ba Yah  around the campfire     another former chairman  William Kennard  says   You have to have an   answer   One day last spring  Powell  testifying before a Senate   subcommittee  delivered an anodyne opening statement  and the   subcommittee s chairman  Ernest Hollings  of South Carolina  berated   him   You don t care about these regulations   Hollings said   You don t   care about the law or what Congress sets down        That s the   fundamental  That s the misgiving I have of your administration over   there  It just is amazing to me  You just pell mell down the road and   seem to not care at all  I think you d be a wonderful executive   vice president of a chamber of commerce  but not a chairman of a   regulatory commission at the government level  Are you happy in your job        Extremely   Powell said  with an amiable smile        One cannot understand Powell s maddening effect  at least on Democrats   and liberal activists  without understanding not just the stated purpose   of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose  The F C C  was   created by Congress in 1934  but it existed in prototype well before the   New Deal  because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy   cases for government intervention in the private economy  making sure   that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves  Its   other original function was preventing American Telephone   Telegraph    the national monopoly phone company  from treating its customers   unfairly  Over the decades  as F C C  World grew up into a comfortable    well established place  the F C C  segued into the role of industrial   supervision its real purpose  It was supposed to manage the competition   among communications companies so that it didn t become too bloody  by   artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business    In addition to looking out for the public s interest  the commission   more specifically protected the interests of members of Congress  many   of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most   terrifying category of interest group you can cross the local bank   president and live to tell the tale  but not the local broadcaster    According to an oft told F C C  World anecdote  President Clinton once   blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers   in the same city because  he said  if the so and so who owned the   anti Clinton Little Rock Democrat Gazette had owned the leading TV   station in Little Rock  too  Clinton would never have become President        F C C  World may have been con tentious  but it was settled  too    because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic   niches for themselves  Then  in the nineteen eighties  the successful   breakup of A T    T  by far the biggest and most important company the   commission regulated deposited a thick additional sediment of   self confidence onto the consciousness of F C C  World  A generation   ago  for most Americans  there was one local phone company  one   long distance company  and one company that manufactured telephones    which customers were not permitted to own and they were all the same   company  It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line  By the   mid nineteen nineties  there were a dozen economically viable local   phone companies  a handful of national long distance companies competing   to offer customers the lowest price and best service  and stores   everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers and   millions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the   telephone lines  A T    T  had argued for years that it was a  natural   monopoly   requiring protection from economic competition and total   control over its lines  So much for that argument  Over the same period    the F C C  had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones   and the Internet  It was the dream of federal agency success come true    consumers vastly better served  and the industry much bigger and more   prosperous  too      The next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996    one of those massive  endlessly lobbied over pieces of legislation which   most people outside F C C  World probably felt it was safe to ignore    Although the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of   modernization and deregulation  its essence was a grand interest group   bargain  in which the local phone companies  known to headline writers   as  baby Bells  and to F C C  World as  arbocks   the pronounced version   of RBOCs  or regional Bell operating companies   would be permitted to   offer long distance service in exchange for letting the long distance   companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for   customers  Consumers would win  because for the first time they would   get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more   competition than they already had in long distance  But the politics and   economics of the Telecom Act  which was shepherded through Congress by   Vice President Gore  were just as important  Democrats saw the act as   helping to reposition them as the technology party the party that   brought the Internet into every home  created hundreds of thousands of   jobs in new companies  and  not least  set off an investment boom whose   beneficiaries might become the party s new contributor base  Clinton s   slogans about the  information superhighway  and  building a bridge to   the twenty first century   which  like all Clinton slogans  artfully   sent different messages to different constituencies  were the rhetorical   correlates of the Telecom Act  and Gore s cruise to the Presidency was   supposed to be powered substantially by the act s success      The F C C  had a crucial role in all this  The arbocks are rich    aggressive  politically powerful  and generally Republican  though like   all important interest groups they work with both parties   they   immediately filed lawsuits  which wound up tying the hands of their new   competitors in the local phone market for more than three years  Through   rule making  enforcement  and litigation  the F C C   then headed by   Reed Hundt  who was Gore s classmate at St  Albans  was supposed to keep   the arbocks in their cages  so that not only long distance companies   like A T    T  and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new   companies   see lecks   the pronounced version of CLECs  or competitive   local exchange carriers   could emerge  This entailed the regulatory   equivalent of hand to hand combat  the see leck is supposed to have   access to the arbock s switching equipment  the arbock won t give the   seeleck a key to the room where it s kept  so the see leck asks the   F C C  to rule that the arbock has to give it the key      Partly because Hundt assured the see lecks and other new companies that   he would protect them  and partly because of the generally booming   condition of the economy then  investment capital flooded into the   see lecks companies with names like Winstar  Covad  and Teligent and   into other telecommunications companies  Even not obviously related   technology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom   boom  demand for their products was supposed to come from the see lecks   and other new players  There would be no conflict between the interests   of the new telecom companies and those of consumers  as one of Hundt s   former lieutenants told me   Reed used to joke that my job was to make   sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up         The years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the   boom  Wall Street had its blood up  and that meant not just more   startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies    Time Warner and AOL decided to throw in together  and A T    T  and   Comcast  and so on   Surely  WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys   believed that their self dealing  stock overselling  and creative   accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating       By the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been   determined  the telecom crash was well under way  Nonetheless  the   chairmanship of the F C C  remained one of the best jobs  in terms of   influence and visibility  available to a career government regulator    Three Republicans emerged as candidates  Powell  who was a commissioner    Harold Furchtgott Roth  the farthest to the right commissioner  and   Patrick Wood  the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and  as   such  a George W  Bush guy  In Texas  however  Wood had crossed the most   powerful person in the arbock camp  Edward Whitacre  the C E O  of   S B C  Communications  which is headquartered in San Antonio  This meant   that the arbocks didn t want Wood as head of the F C C   because he   might be too pro see leck   Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy   Regulatory Commission   Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he   wasn t as threatening as Wood  while also signalling the conservative   movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than   Furchtgott Roth      Powell did this deftly  For example  in December of 2000 he appeared   before a conservative group called the Progress   Freedom Foundation and   gave a very Michael Powell speech whimsical  intellectual  and   free associative  Biblical history  Joseph Schumpeter  Moore s Law  that   began by making fun of the idea that the F C C  should try to keep new   telecom companies alive   In the wake of the 1996 Act  the F C C  is   often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas   Powell said   Like the   Whos  down in Who ville  who feast on Who pudding and rare Who roast   beast  the communications industry was preparing to feast on the   deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act s   fertile soil  But this feast the F C C  Grinch did not like in the   least  so it is thought   Thus Powell was indicating that if he became   chairman he didn t expect to administer first aid to the see lecks as   part of the job  He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day   of the Bush Administration      Twenty months into the Administration  nearly all the see lecks are dead   or dying  nearly all long distance companies  not just WorldCom  are in   serious trouble  cable companies have lost half their value  satellite   companies are staggering  The crash has had an automatically   concentrating effect  because as new companies die the existing   companies  market share increases  and  if the existing companies are in   good shape financially  they have the opportunity to pick up damaged   companies at bargain prices  During the Bush Administration  as the   financial carnage in communications has worsened  the communications   industry has moved in the direction of more concentration  If the Bells   wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service  and   if they also merge  the country will be on its way to having a national   duopoly in local service  Verizon  in the East  and S B C   in the West    And these companies could dominate long distance as well  because of the   poor health of the long distance companies      The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national   companies  AOL Time Warner and Comcast  Unlike the phone companies  they   don t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more   fully control what material they allow to enter people s homes  As part   of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996   Telecom Act  the limits on concentration in the radio industry were   significantly loosened  and in the past six years the number of   radio station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty five   per cent  today  a large portion of local and national radio news   programming is supplied by a single company  Westwood One  a subsidiary   of Viacom      In this situation  many Democrats and liberals think  the F C C  should   be hyperactive the superhero of government regulation  springing to the   rescue of both consumers and the communications industry  It should try   to breathe life into the see lecks and other new companies  It should   disallow mergers  maintain ownership limits  and otherwise restrain the   forces of concentration  It should use the government s money and muscle   to get new technology especially fast Internet connections into the   homes of people who can t afford it at current market prices   An   analogy that a lot of people in F C C  World make is between telecom and   the Middle East  the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush   people  because they disengaged when they came into office  and the Bush   people blame it on the Clinton people  because they raised too many   expectations and stirred too many passions       But Michael Powell s F C C  has not been hyperactive  Powell has been   conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the   F C C  and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him   signals   In mid September  Powell finally initiated a formal review of   the F C C  s limits on media concentration   This doesn t mean he has   been inactive  rather  he has been active in a way that further   infuriates his critics in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and   the provocative  he muses about whether the fundamental premises of   F C C  World really make sense  while giving the impression that he s   having the time of his life as chairman  At his first press conference    when he was asked what he was going to do about the  digital   divide  that is  economic inequality in access to the Internet he said     You know  I think there is a Mercedes divide  I d like to have one and   I can t afford one   At the National Cable   Telecommunications   Association convention  in Chicago  Powell  following a troupe of   tumblers to the stage  interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a   somersault        Not long ago  I went to see Powell in his office at the F C C  Until   1998  when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest   Washington  near the city s open air fish market  F C C  World was at   the western edge of downtown  where everybody would encounter everybody   else at a few familiar restaurants and bars  Today  the F C C  building   looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park    Even the chairman s suite  though large  is beige  carpeted  and   fluorescent  Powell is a bulky man who wears gold rimmed glasses and   walks with a pronounced limp  the result of injuries he suffered in a   jeep accident in Germany  in 1987  when he was an Army officer  Because   of the accident  he left the Army and went to law school  where he   became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation  particularly   the idea that the government  rather than trying to correct the flaws of   the market before the fact  prophylactically   as he likes to say should   wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust   litigation to fix them  He worked briefly at a corporate law firm  and   then became a prot g  of Joel Klein  the head of the antitrust division   of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government s   legal case against Microsoft   He was recently appointed chancellor of   the New York public school system   It testifies to Powell s political   skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush   Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but   also maintains close ties to Bush s nemesis Senator John McCain  of   Arizona  One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his   enduring love of law school  It s sort of like a law school study   session over there   one Democratic former commissioner said  As if to   confirm the charge  Powell  when I arrived  introduced me to four law   students  summer interns at the commission  whom he d invited to sit in      I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions   of the F C C  For example  could private companies have apportioned the   airwaves among themselves without the government being involved       I think we ll never know   Powell said   I don t think it s an   automatically bad idea  the way some people will argue  Land is probably   the best analogue  We don t seize all the land in the United States and   say   The government will issue licenses to use land   If my neighbor   puts a fence one foot onto my property line  there s a whole body of law   about what I can do about that  including whether I can tear it down  If   a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company  it s a   similar proposition  There are scholars who argue indeed  the famous   Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this that   spectrum policy is lunacy  The market could work this out  in the kinds   of ways that we re accustomed to       Talking to Powell was fun  Unlike most high government officials  he   doesn t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding  He   slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs  He speaks in   ironic air quotes  He s like your libertarian friend in college who   enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions   about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he   sees as sentimental or illogical  After a while  I asked him whether he   thought his predecessors  excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications   Act had been excessive       I would start with a caveat   Powell said   Look  I can t fault those   judgments in and of themselves  given the time and what people thought    They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities    But  frankly  I ve always been a little bit critical  First of all    anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn t come anywhere close   to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it  by the President   on down  about the kinds of things it s going to open up  I mean  I   don t know what provisions are the information superhighway provisions    or what provisions are so digitally oriented  or some of the things that   were a big part of the theatre of its introduction  When one starts   reading the details  one searches  often in vain  for these provisions    But  nonetheless  there was a rising dot com excitement  and an Internet   excitement  and people thought this was historic legislation  and it   certainly was       But  We were sucking helium out of balloons  with the kinds of   expectations that were being bandied around  and this is before the   economy or the market even gets in trouble  It was a dramatically   exaggerated expectation by the leadership of the commission  by   politicians  by the market itself  by companies themselves  It was a   gold rush  and led to some very detrimental business decisions  ones   that government encouraged by its policies  frankly  Everybody wanted to   see numbers go up on the board       Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act       I want to see ten competitors  Twenty competitors  I want to see   thirty per cent market share  Fifty per cent market share  I want the   Bells to bleed  Then we ll know we ve succeeded     Now Powell returned   to being Powell   I think that expectation was astonishingly   unrealistic  in the short term  They wanted to see it while they re   there  We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking  And   the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking  There s no   question  we went too soon too fast  Too many companies took on too much   debt too fast before the market really had a product  or a business model       How could the Telecom Act have been handled better   We could have   chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective  and were   slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system     Powell said   Money chased what seemed like government promised   opportunity  The problem with that is there s a morning after  and we re   in it  And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem  This   debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level  In some   ways  for short term gain  we paid a price in long term stability       Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there   had been a more  reasonable  level of investment   No  we wouldn t have   every home in America with competitive choice yet but we don t anyway  I   don t think it s the remonopolization of telephone service  I don t buy   that  The Bells will prosper  but did anybody believe they wouldn t  The   part of the story that didn t materialize was that people thought so   would MCI WorldCom and Sprint       Other local phone companies  he added  hadn t materialized as viable   businesses  either  and they never might   Everybody s always saying     The regulators did this and this and this   But  candidly  the story s   quite the opposite  I think the regulators bent over backward for six   years to give them a chance  Conditions don t get that good except once   every thirty years  and it didn t happen  So  whatever the reason  we re   looking at a WorldCom that s teetering  We re looking at a long distance   business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base  A T    T  is   breaking itself up  Sprint has struggled       Could the F C C  have done anything to make the long distance companies   stronger   At the F C C   I think I ll just be blunt  My political   answer  Yes  there s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try   to help  But I can t find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere    I can t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S E C    investigation  Were I king  it would be wonderful  but I don t have   those kinds of levers  I don t know whether anybody does  At some point    companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from   dying   Powell couldn t have made it much clearer that he doesn t think   it s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash  He has   demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist   gestures in August  for example  five months after disbanding the   F C C  s Accounting Safeguards Division  Powell announced that he was   appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the   communications industry  But that shows that Powell is better at riding   out the storm than  say  Harvey Pitt  his counterpart at the Securities   and Exchange Commission  and does not mean that he plans to try to shore   up the telecom industry      I asked Powell if it would bother him if  for most people  only one   company provided cable television and only one provided local phone   service   Yes   he said   It concerns us that there s one of each of   those things  but let s not diminish the importance of there being one   of each of those things  That still is a nice suite of communications   capabilities  even if they aren t direct analogues of each other     Anyway  Powell said  before long the phone companies will be able to   provide video service over their lines  and the cable companies will   provide data service over their lines  so there will be more choice     So  yeah  we have this anxiety  we have one of everything  The question   is  Does it stay that way       The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of   information did not appear to trouble Powell  either  He said that   people confuse bigness  which brings many benefits  with concentration    which distorts markets   If this were just economics  it s easy  If you   were to say to me   Mike  just worry about economic concentration   we   know how to do that the econometrics of antitrust  I can tell you when a   market s too concentrated and prices are going to rise  The problem is   other dimensions  like political  ideological  sometimes emotional  Take   the question of  if everybody s controlling what you see  the assumption   there is that somehow there ll be this viewpoint  a monolithic   viewpoint  pushed on you by your media and you won t get diversity  I   think that s a possibility  I don t think it s nearly the possibility   that s ascribed to it sometimes       Powell explained   Sometimes when we see very pointed political or   parochial programming  it gets attacked as unfair  I see some of the   same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh   exists  They love diversity  but somehow we should run Howard Stern off   the planet  If it has a point of view  then it becomes accused of bias    and then we have policies like  here his tone went from ironic to   sarcastic  the fairness doctrine  which seems to me like the antithesis   of what I thought those people cared about  So when somebody is pointed   and opinionated  we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic   fairness and integrity or whatever  to make them balance it out         F C C  World abounds in theories about Michael Powell  One is that he   can t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries   he regulates so he talks  and talks and talks  flamboyantly about the   market  in order to buy himself time  Another is that he s carrying   water for the arbocks and the big cable companies  Another is that he is   planning to run for the Senate from Virginia  or to be appointed   Attorney General in a second Bush term   and doesn t want to do anything   at the F C C  that would diminish his chances  Another is that he s   waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action    so that he doesn t wind up going first and getting caught in the   crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television   networks   In F C C  World  this is known as the Powell Doctrine of   Telecom  after Colin Powell s idea that the United States should never   commit itself militarily without a clear objective  overwhelming force    and an exit strategy   And another is that he actually believes what he   says  and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural  healthy  and   irreversible  and more concentration would be just fine       This is why elections matter   Reed Hundt  who isn t happy about what   has become of his Telecom Act  told me  It s true that the F C C  much   more than  say  the war in Afghanistan is a case in which a Gore   Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush   Administration  Consumers might have noticed the difference by now  but   there s no question whether communications companies have noticed  The   arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would   have done if Gore had won  Next election  they ll help the party that   helped them  If the Republicans win  policy will tilt further in the   arbocks  favor  If they lose  perhaps the arbocks  rivals the   long distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts with their   friends now in power  will stage a comeback  America s present is not   unrecognizably

Reza B Far wrote   This thread kind of surprises me    I started coding with C  then C    and  moved on to Java    And  I think that  Robert Harley wrote   Looks like a case of  MY experience is comprehensive  YOUR S is  anecdotal  THEY don t know what they re talking about    Well  I sure don t claim that    I think most people on Fork probably have more programming knowledge than I do    There s lots of experience out here     Reza B Far wrote   1   The people who pay the wages don t give a flyin  heck what programming  language you write things in    they just want it to work  Robert Harley wrote   In my experience  they do care   It has to work certainly  and in  particular it has to work with what they ve already got  and it has to  work on client s systems   My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on  Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven t come back yet   Well  I think until recently  support for most things on Linux was kind of shady    Things have got much better    You re right in that the JDK used to suck on Linux    But then  IMHO  Linux is still maturing     or at least development tools for Linux are maturing    I ve been developing a few server side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1 3 x and they ve had no problems with great performance   Robert Harley worte   Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows   They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a  service pack   Somehow  I can t imagine them removing the ability to  run C programs   Hmmm    Do you really think that MS is pulling out Java because it s a  Bad  programming language or application platform   You don t think this has anything to do with  NET being a competitor to Java do you   Or that MS has basically copied Java  with some additional features  and called it C   Isn t that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the right way to go for most high level applications   Reza B Far wrote   2   C and C   forces the developer to solve problems such as memory  management over and over again  Robert Harley wrote   Can t say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management  issues  apart from the fact that I frequently need   4 GB   Hmmm again     You re telling me that you ve never had a nasty bug that took you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak   I am not the best C C   programmer    not even close    But I ve known really good ones    and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory management  however occasional they may be    It s about design patterns  architecture  high level stuff    Robert Harley wrote   If your problem just requires application of a  design pattern  to solve   then it s trivial anyway irrespective of language   Wow   So you re telling me that unless the application involves bit counting  it s trivial   What about the application itself   What about high level problems such as task distribution  work flow  etc    Aren t most high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns  Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C C   code   For example  do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks  there are lots of them on this list   are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment    I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low  level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over  and over again    Robert Harley wrote   You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time  on irrelevant low level problems and Java programmers don t   Depends  entirely on the programmer  not the language   I can see how you could infer this  However  what I believe to really be the case is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more than three programmers   In those cases  it s always very hard to get the programmers to agree on API s  memory management techniques  etc   With Java  the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don t sit around in a long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database  JDBC  or a messaging bus  JMS      3   Java is not just a programming language  It s also a platform    Robert Harley wrote   Buzzword   YIKES   Have you written db code with C C   for different databases  just an example    Tried porting a persistence layer from Windows to Unix   Say you have Informix running on Solaris and you want to port to Windows with MS SQL  bad idea   but for the sake of the example   would you rather deal with JDBC port or C C   port that uses Informix drivers and now you have to use ODBC     a monolithic set of API s or a crap load of different API s slicing  and dicing the same problems 50 different ways  Robert Harley wrote   Unsupported assertion   So  are you saying that there is a standard set of API s for C C   for everything   aside to the minimal ANSI stuff    Is there a standard way of dealing with C C   applications for various domain problems  messaging  database persistence  etc   that rivals Java   I d like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes C C      In that case  I claim ignorance     Not suggesting that Java is the golden hammer     Just that C C   is overkill for most things    I even coded in VB    But VB is a true disgrace to programming    It s just lame    Java is Object Oriented     no flame mail from the anti OO people please    that is a religious discussion     and relatively clean    And I don t think that every  Kid  can write a well designed Java program   Kids typically don t understand various design patterns and principles    To my experience  they actually tend to think more of the low level problems  wanting to rewrite and reinvent the world    a tendency that is much more possible  IMHO  in C C   than in Java due to existence of standard API s   \n",

      "   A world where some live in comfort and plenty  while half of the human   race lives on less than  2 a day  is neither just nor stable   Absolutely correct  Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on Earth today   The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy that bears close reading  It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world      The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations  It does    however  reveal the clash inside a civilization  a battle for the   future of the Muslim world  This is a struggle of ideas and this is an   area where America must excel   I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa  our new music and news channel for 15 30 year old Arabs  It s  1 in practically every market it s entered  nearing 90  listenership in Amman  And it s even beginning to be trusted for news  well past BBC and taking share from every other government broadcaster   It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long term as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term   Many of you may disagree  but I found the document below surprisingly centrist  If you know the code  you can hear clearly partisan tones  re  ICC  Taiwan Relations Act  etc  But  still  this is as much a Democratic platform as not  Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared they might   As you read  replace  United States  with  Roman Empire  and it may make as much sense  in the long view of history  I don t know how proud to be about that  but it is telling  Sometime I daydream that the President might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700  military installations overseas and what they do for us  It would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us   Heck  I d love to see a real time map of Federal expenditures around the globe  a softly glowing necklace of embassies  carriers  arctic research stations  hotels  golf courses  warehouses  libraries  clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy   Of course  this still doesn t leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document  the Bush Doctrine for pre emptive strikes  I d sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world   Rohit                                                        September 20  2002  Full Text  Bush s National Security Strategy  Following is the full text of President Bush s new national security strategy  The document  entitled  The National Security Strategy of the United States   will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of the Administration s policy   INTRODUCTION  THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom    and a single sustainable model for national success  freedom  democracy  and free enterprise  In the twenty first century  only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity  People everywhere want to say what they think  choose who will govern them  worship as they please  educate their children    male and female  own property  and enjoy the benefits of their labor  These values of freedom are right and true for every person  in every society    and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom loving people across the globe and across the ages   Today  the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence  In keeping with our heritage and principles  we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage  We seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom  conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty  By making the world safer  we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better  We will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants  We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers  We will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent   Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the Federal Government  Today  that task has changed dramatically  Enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger America  Now  shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank  Terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us   To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal    from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing  The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration  America will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror  And America will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror    because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization  The United States and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases  Together  we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn   The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology  Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction  and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination  The United States will not allow these efforts to succeed  We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery  We will cooperate with other nations to deny  contain  and curtail our enemies  efforts to acquire dangerous technologies  And  as a matter of common sense and self defense  America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed  We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best  So we must be prepared to defeat our enemies  plans  using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation  History will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act  In the new world we have entered  the only path to safety is the path of action   As we defend the peace  we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace  Today  the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war  Today  the world s great powers find ourselves on the same side    united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos  The United States will build on these common interests to promote global security  We are also increasingly united by common values  Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition  reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror  Chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth  In time  they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness  America will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations  because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order  We will strongly resist aggression from other great powers    even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity  trade  and cultural advancement   Finally  the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe  We will actively work to bring the hope of democracy  development  free markets  and free trade to every corner of the world  The events of September 11  2001  taught us that weak states  like Afghanistan  can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states  Poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers  Yet poverty  weak institutions  and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders   The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people  Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty    so the United States will work with individual nations  entire regions  and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity  The United States will deliver greater development assistance through the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly  invest in their people  and encourage economic freedom  We will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of AIDS and other infectious diseases   In building a balance of power that favors freedom  the United States is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities  Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror  Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction  Nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely  so that aid is well spent  For freedom to thrive  accountability must be expected and required   We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer  better world alone  Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom loving nations  The United States is committed to lasting institutions like the United Nations  the World Trade Organization  the Organization of American States  and NATO as well as other long standing alliances  Coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions  In all cases  international obligations are to be taken seriously  They are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment   Freedom is the non negotiable demand of human dignity  the birthright of every person    in every civilization  Throughout history  freedom has been threatened by war and terror  it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants  and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease  Today  humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom s triumph over all these foes  The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission   I  Overview of America s International Strategy    Our Nation s cause has always been larger than our Nation s defense  We fight  as we always fight  for a just peace    a peace that favors liberty  We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants  We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers  And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent         President Bush West Point  New York June 1  2002    The United States possesses unprecedented    and unequaled    strength and influence in the world  Sustained by faith in the principles of liberty  and the value of a free society  this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities  obligations  and opportunity  The great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom   For most of the twentieth century  the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas  destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality   That great struggle is over  The militant visions of class  nation  and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited  America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones  We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few  We must defeat these threats to our Nation  allies  and friends   This is also a time of opportunity for America  We will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace  prosperity  and liberty  The U S  national security strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests  The aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better  Our goals on the path to progress are clear  political and economic freedom  peaceful relations with other states  and respect for human dignity   And this path is not America s alone  It is open to all   To achieve these goals  the United States will     champion aspirations for human dignity     strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends     work with others to defuse regional conflicts     prevent our enemies from threatening us  our allies  and our friends  with weapons of mass destruction     ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade     expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy     develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power  and    transform America s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century    II  Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity    Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong  I disagree  Different circumstances require different methods  but not different moralities        President Bush West Point  New York June 1  2002    In pursuit of our goals  our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for  the United States must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere  No nation owns these aspirations  and no nation is exempt from them  Fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence  No people on earth yearn to be oppressed  aspire to servitude  or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police   America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity  the rule of law  limits on the absolute power of the state  free speech  freedom of worship  equal justice  respect for women  religious and ethnic tolerance  and respect for private property   These demands can be met in many ways  America s constitution has served us well  Many other nations  with different histories and cultures  facing different circumstances  have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance  History has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people   Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals  But even in our worst moments  the principles enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were there to guide us  As a result  America is not just a stronger  but is a freer and more just society   Today  these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty  And when openings arrive  we can encourage change    as we did in central and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991  or in Belgrade in 2000  When we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in the Republic of Korea  and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin America and Africa  we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve  marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish   Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today  the national security strategy of the United States must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty   Our principles will guide our government s decisions about international cooperation  the character of our foreign assistance  and the allocation of resources  They will guide our actions and our words in international bodies   We will     speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom     use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non violently for it  ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take     make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations  seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future  and    take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments    We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it   III  Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent Attacks Against Us and Our Friends    Just three days removed from these events  Americans do not yet have the distance of history  But our responsibility to history is already clear  to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil  War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder  This nation is peaceful  but fierce when stirred to anger  The conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others  It will end in a way  and at an hour  of our choosing        President Bush Washington  D C   The National Cathedral  September 14  2001    The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach  The enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology  The enemy is terrorism    premeditated  politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents   In many regions  legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace  Such grievances deserve to be  and must be  addressed within a political process  But no cause justifies terror  The United States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them  We make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them   The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history  It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time  Progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes    some seen  some unseen   Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can  and will  do against regimes that harbor  support  and use terrorism to achieve their political goals  Afghanistan has been liberated  coalition forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al Qaida  But it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists  Thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America  South America  Europe  Africa  the Middle East  and across Asia   Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership  command  control  and communications  material support  and finances  This will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists  ability to plan and operate   We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists  Once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state  we will help ensure the state has the military  law enforcement  political  and financial tools necessary to finish the task   The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism  We will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism  freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them  deny terrorists access to the international financial system  protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists  and prevent the movement of terrorists  assets through alternative financial networks   However  this campaign need not be sequential to be effective  the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek   We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by     direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power  Our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction  WMD  or their precursors     defending the United States  the American people  and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders  While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community  we will not hesitate to act alone  if necessary  to exercise our right of self defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists  to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country  and    denying further sponsorship  support  and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities    We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism  This includes     using the full influence of the United States  and working closely with allies and friends  to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery  piracy  or genocide  behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose     supporting moderate and modern government  especially in the Muslim world  to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation     diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk  and    using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism    While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening America s homeland security to protect against and deter attack   This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council and the Department of Defense  Centered on a new Department of Homeland Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the FBI  our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector   This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity  For example  emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards  Our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror  but all infectious diseases and mass casualty dangers  Our border controls will not just stop terrorists  but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic   While our focus is protecting America  we know that to defeat terrorism in today s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends  Wherever possible  the United States will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism  Where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities  we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide   As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan  we will continue to work with international organizations such as the United Nations  as well as non governmental organizations  and other countries to provide the humanitarian  political  economic  and security assistance necessary to rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people  threaten its neighbors  and provide a haven for terrorists  In the war against global terrorism  we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life  Freedom and fear are at war  and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict  In leading the campaign against terrorism  we are forging new  productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty first century   IV  Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts    We build a world of justice  or we will live in a world of coercion  The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small        President Bush Berlin  Germany May 23  2002    Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering  In an increasingly interconnected world  regional crisis can strain our alliances  rekindle rivalries among the major powers  and create horrifying affronts to human dignity  When violence erupts and states falter  the United States will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability   No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U S  action    direct or indirect    is warranted  We have finite political  economic  and military resources to meet our global priorities  The United States will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind     The United States should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge     The United States should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves  Where and when people are ready to do their part  we will be willing to move decisively    Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles   The Israeli Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering  because of America s close relationship with the state of Israel and key Arab states  and because of that region s importance to other global priorities of the United States  There can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides  America stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine  living beside Israel in peace and security  Like all other people  Palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests  and listens to their voices  and counts their votes  The United States will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict   The United States  the international donor community  and the World Bank stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic development  increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish  finance  and monitor a truly independent judiciary  If Palestinians embrace democracy  and the rule of law  confront corruption  and firmly reject terror  they can count on American support for the creation of a Palestinian state   Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine  Permanent occupation threatens Israel s identity and democracy  So the United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable  credible Palestinian state  As there is progress towards security  Israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to September 28  2000  And consistent with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee  Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop  As violence subsides  freedom of movement should be restored  permitting innocent Palestinians to resume work and normal life  The United States can play a crucial role but  ultimately  lasting peace can only come when Israelis and Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them   In South Asia  the United States has also emphasized the need for India and Pakistan to resolve their disputes  This administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and Pakistan  These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute  With Pakistan  our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan s choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society  The Administration sees India s potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly  Our involvement in this regional dispute  building on earlier investments in bilateral relations  looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation   Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law  By tolerating ethnic minorities  respecting the rule of law  and accepting open markets  Indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation  It is the initiative by Indonesia that allows U S  assistance to make a difference   In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities  particularly Mexico  Brazil  Canada  Chile  and Colombia  Together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security  prosperity  opportunity  and hope  We will work with regional institutions  such as the Summit of the Americas process  the Organization of American States  OAS   and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere   Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict  especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices  This conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the United States  Therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies  enforce their laws  defeat terrorist organizations  and cut off the supply of drugs  while    as important    we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country   In Colombia  we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups  We are working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the Colombian people   In Africa  promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease  war  and desperate poverty  This threatens both a core value of the United States    preserving human dignity    and our strategic priority    combating global terror  American interests and American principles  therefore  lead in the same direction  we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty  peace  and growing prosperity  Together with our European allies  we must help strengthen Africa s fragile states  help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders  and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists   An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones  Forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats   Africa s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement  and builds coalitions of the willing  This administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region     countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South Africa  Nigeria  Kenya  and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention     coordination with European allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations  and    Africa s capable reforming states and sub regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis    Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub Saharan Africa  where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference  The transition to the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent   V  Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us  Our Allies  and Our Friends with Weapons of Mass Destruction    The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology  When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons  along with ballistic missile technology    when that occurs  even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations  Our enemies have declared this very intention  and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons  They want the capability to blackmail us  or to harm us  or to harm our friends    and we will oppose them with all our power        President Bush West Point  New York June 1  2002    The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States    with our allies and friends    to emphasize deterrence of the enemy s use of force  producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction  With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War  our security environment has undergone profound transformation   Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with Russia  the dividends are evident  an end to the balance of terror that divided us  an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides  and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable   But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists  None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union  However  the nature and motivations of these new adversaries  their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world s strongest states  and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us  make today s security environment more complex and dangerous   In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that  while different in important ways  share a number of attributes  These states     brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers     display no regard for international law  threaten their neighbors  and callously violate international treaties to which they are party     are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction  along with other advanced military technology  to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes     sponsor terrorism around the globe  and    reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything for which it stands    At the time of the Gulf War  we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq s designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against Iran and its own people  but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents  In the past decade North Korea has become the world s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles  and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal  Other rogue regimes seek nuclear  biological  and chemical weapons as well  These states  pursuit of  and global trade in  such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations   We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies and friends  Our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances  the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries  innovation in the use of military forces  modern technologies  including the development of an effective missile defense system  and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis   Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes     Proactive counterproliferation efforts  We must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed  We must ensure that key capabilities    detection  active and passive defenses  and counterforce capabilities    are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems  Counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine  training  and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD armed adversaries     Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials  technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction  We will enhance diplomacy  arms control  multilateral export controls  and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD  and when necessary  interdict enabling technologies and materials  We will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts  encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs  The recent G 8 agreement to commit up to  20 billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward     Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD use  whether by terrorists or hostile states  Minimizing the effects of WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends  The United States must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our forces abroad  and to help friends and allies if they are attacked    It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat  Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists  the United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past  The inability to deter a potential attacker  the immediacy of today s threats  and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries  choice of weapons  do not permit that option  We cannot let our enemies strike first     In the Cold War  especially following the Cuban missile crisis  we faced a generally status quo  risk averse adversary  Deterrence was an effective defense  But deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks  gambling with the lives of their people  and the wealth of their nations     In the Cold War  weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them  Today  our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice  For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors  These weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states  Such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States     Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents  whose so called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness  The overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to action    For centuries  international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack  Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat    most often a visible mobilization of armies  navies  and air forces preparing to attack   We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today s adversaries  Rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means  They know such attacks would fail  Instead  they rely on acts of terrorism and  potentially  the use of weapons of mass destruction    weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning   The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population  in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare  As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11  2001  mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction   The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security  The greater the threat  the greater is the risk of inaction    and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves  even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy s attack  To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries  the United States will  if necessary  act preemptively   The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats  nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression  Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world s most destructive technologies  the United States cannot remain idle while dangers gather   We will always proceed deliberately  weighing the consequences of our actions  To support preemptive options  we will     build better  more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely  accurate information on threats  wherever they may emerge     coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats  and    continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results    The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the United States or our allies and friends  The reasons for our actions will be clear  the force measured  and the cause just   VI  Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and Free Trade     When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few  no amount    no amount    of development aid is ever enough  When nations respect their people  open markets  invest in better health and education  every dollar of aid  every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively        President Bush Monterrey  Mexico March 22  2002    A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world  Economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes  It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty  spurs economic and legal reform  and the fight against corruption  and it reinforces the habits of liberty   We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America s shores  All governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge  We will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth  including     pro growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment  innovation  and entrepreneurial activity     tax policies    particularly lower marginal tax rates    that improve incentives for work and investment     rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors     strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use     sound fiscal policies to support business activity     investments in health and education that improve the well being and skills of the labor force and population as a whole  and    free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity    The lessons of history are clear  market economies  not command and control economies with the heavy hand of government  are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty  Policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies    industrialized countries  emerging markets  and the developing world   A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U S  national security interests  We want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake  for the sake of the global economy  and for the sake of global security  European efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard  as are Japan s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of non performing loans in the Japanese banking system  We will continue to use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners    including through the Group of Seven  G 7     to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth   Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth  International flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies  These flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty  Our long term objective should be a world in which all countries have investment grade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future   We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost  To this end  we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets  We will work actively with other countries  the International Monetary Fund  IMF   and the private sector to implement the G 7 Action Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur   The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring  and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing so  We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy  exchange rate policy  and financial sector policy   The concept of  free trade  arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics  If you can make something that others value  you should be able to sell it to them  If others make something that you value  you should be able to buy it  This is real freedom  the freedom for a person    or a nation    to make a living  To promote free trade  the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy     Seize the global initiative  The new global trade negotiations we helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda  especially in agriculture  manufacturing  and services  targeted for completion in 2005  The United States has led the way in completing the accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade Organization  We will assist Russia s preparations to join the WTO     Press regional initiatives  The United States and other democracies in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas  targeted for completion in 2005  This year the United States will advocate market access negotiations with its partners  targeted on agriculture  industrial goods  services  investment  and government procurement  We will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent  Africa  starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act  and leading to free trade     Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements  Building on the free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001  the Administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore  Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world  Initially  Central America  Southern Africa  Morocco  and Australia will be our principal focal points     Renew the executive congressional partnership  Every administration s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with Congress  After a gap of 8 years  the Administration reestablished majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002  This Administration will work with Congress to enact new bilateral  regional  and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade Promotion Authority     Promote the connection between trade and development  Trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights  competition  the rule of law  investment  the spread of knowledge  open societies  the efficient allocation of resources  and regional integration    all leading to growth  opportunity  and confidence in developing countries  The United States is implementing The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market access for nearly all goods produced in the 35 countries of sub Saharan Africa  We will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities  Beyond market access  the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health  We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV AIDS  tuberculosis  and malaria     Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices  Commerce depends on the rule of law  international trade depends on enforceable agreements  Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the European Union  Canada  and Mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology  science  and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture  Laws against unfair trade practices are often abused  but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping  International industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred     Help domestic industries and workers adjust  There is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the American steel industry  The benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices  These safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American workers  Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets     Protect the environment and workers  The United States must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity  We will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into U S  trade negotiations  creating a healthy  network  between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO  and use the International Labor Organization  trade preference programs  and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade     Enhance energy security  We will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies  trading partners  and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied  especially in the Western Hemisphere  Africa  Central Asia  and the Caspian region  We will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies    Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth  containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate  Our overall objective is to reduce America s greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy  cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 years  by the year 2012  Our strategies for attaining this goal will be to     remain committed to the basic U N  Framework Convention for international cooperation     obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts     develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions     promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology  as well as nuclear power    which produces no greenhouse gas emissions  while also improving fuel economy for U S  cars and trucks     increase spending on research and new conservation technologies  to a total of  4 5 billion    the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a  700 million increase over last year s budget  and    assist developing countries  especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as China and India  so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path    VII  Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building the Infrastructure of Democracy    In World War II we fought to make the world safer  then worked to rebuild it  As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror  we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens        President Bush Washington  D C   Inter American Development Bank  March 14  2002    A world where some live in comfort and plenty  while half of the human race lives on less than  2 a day  is neither just nor stable  Including all of the world s poor in an expanding circle of development    and opportunity    is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of U S  international policy   Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries  Worse  development aid has often served to prop up failed policies  relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery  Results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors  not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients  These are the indicators of a failed strategy   Working with other nations  the United States is confronting this failure  We forged a new consensus at the U N  Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance    and the strategies to achieve those objectives    must change   This Administration s goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations  Sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies  Where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance  The United States and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target  to double the size of the world s poorest economies within a decade   The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal     Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform  We propose a 50 percent increase in the core development assistance given by the United States  While continuing our present programs  including humanitarian assistance based on need alone  these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly  invest in their people  and encourage economic freedom  Governments must fight corruption  respect basic human rights  embrace the rule of law  invest in health care and education  follow responsible economic policies  and enable entrepreneurship  The Millennium Challenge Account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms     Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development banks in raising living standards  The United States is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world s poor  We have reversed the downward trend in U S  contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U S  contributions to the International Development Association  IDA     the World Bank s fund for the poorest countries    and the African Development Fund  The key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth  especially in the poorest countries  We will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity  such as improvements in education  health  rule of law  and private sector development  Every project  every loan  every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries     Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world s poor  When it comes to economic development  what really matters is that more children are getting a better education  more people have access to health care and clean water  or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families  We have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results  For this reason  we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals  Thanks to U S  leadership  the recent IDA replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries  progress  For the first time  donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the achievement of actual development results  and part of the U S  contribution is linked in this way  We will strive to make sure that the World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do     Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans  Greater use of results based grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments  particularly in the social sectors  without saddling them with ever larger debt burdens  As a result of U S  leadership  the recent IDA agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education  HIV AIDS  health  nutrition  water  sanitation  and other human needs  Our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks  We will also challenge universities  nonprofits  and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results     Open societies to commerce and investment  Trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth  Even if government aid increases  most money for development must come from trade  domestic capital  and foreign investment  An effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well  Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy     Secure public health  The scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous  In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like HIV AIDS  malaria  and tuberculosis  growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained  Resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance  which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure  The United States has strongly backed the new global fund for HIV AIDS organized by U N  Secretary General Kofi Annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care  The United States already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor  If the global fund demonstrates its promise  we will be ready to give even more     Emphasize education  Literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development  Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources are devoted to education  This proportion should grow  The United States will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in Africa  The United States can also bring information technology to these societies  many of whose education systems have been devastated by AIDS     Continue to aid agricultural development  New technologies  including biotechnology  have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water  Using sound science  the United States should help bring these benefits to the 800 million people  including 300 million children  who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition    VIII  Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers of Global Power    We have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war        President Bush West Point  New York June 1  2002    America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions    as broad as practicable    of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom  Effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities  an appreciation of others  interests  and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility   There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in Canada and Europe  Europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   which has  since its inception  been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter European security  and the European Union  EU   our partner in opening world trade   The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO  as NATO itself recognized when it invoked its Article V self defense clause for the first time  NATO s core mission    collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies    remains  but NATO must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances  NATO must build a capability to field  at short notice  highly mobile  specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance   The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened  creating coalitions under NATO s own mandate  as well as contributing to mission based coalitions  To achieve this  we must     expand NATO s membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests     ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare     develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces     take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities     streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training  integrating  and experimenting with new force configurations  and    maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces    If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes  the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the Cold War  We will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests  At the same time  we welcome our European allies  efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the EU  and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO  We cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come   The attacks of September 11 energized America s Asian alliances  Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an attack on Australia itself  following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world s finest combat forces for Operation Enduring Freedom  Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack  We have deepened cooperation on counter terrorism with our alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand   The war against terrorism has proven that America s alliances in Asia not only underpin regional peace and stability  but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges  To enhance our Asian alliances and friendships  we will      look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests  our common values  and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation     work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longer term     build on 50 years of U S  Australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems    as we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora     maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies  our requirements  our technological advances  and the strategic environment  and    build on stability provided by these alliances  as well as with institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum  to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region    We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition  Several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition    most importantly Russia  India  and China  In all three cases  recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape   With Russia  we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty first century  the United States and Russia are no longer strategic adversaries  The Moscow Treaty on Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive  long term relations with the Euro Atlantic community and the United States  Russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country s current weakness and the policies    internal and external    needed to reverse those weaknesses  They understand  increasingly  that Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas   United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges  We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism  We are facilitating Russia s entry into the World Trade Organization  without lowering standards for accession  to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations  We have created the NATO Russia Council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among Russia  our European allies  and ourselves  We will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce Russia s growing commitment to integration into the Euro Atlantic community   At the same time  we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership  Lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our relations  Russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern  Russia s very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation  Nevertheless  those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years    or even decades   The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with India based on a conviction that U S  interests require a strong relationship with India  We are the two largest democracies  committed to political freedom protected by representative government  India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well  We have a common interest in the free flow of commerce  including through the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean  Finally  we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia   Differences remain  including over the development of India s nuclear and missile programs  and the pace of India s economic reforms  But while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about India  today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests  Through a strong partnership with India  we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future   The United States relationship with China is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable  peaceful  and prosperous Asia Pacific region  We welcome the emergence of a strong  peaceful  and prosperous China  The democratic development of China is crucial to that future  Yet  a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the Communist legacy  China s leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state  In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the Asia Pacific region  China is following an outdated path that  in the end  will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness  In time  China will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness   The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing China  We already cooperate well where our interests overlap  including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean peninsula  Likewise  we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and similar transitional concerns  Shared health and environmental threats  such as the spread of HIV AIDS  challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens   Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become more open with information  promote the development of civil society  and enhance individual human rights  China has begun to take the road to political openness  permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village level elections  yet remains strongly committed to national one party rule by the Communist Party  To make that nation truly accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations  however  much work remains to be done  Only by allowing the Chinese people to think  assemble  and worship freely can China reach its full potential   Our important trade relationship will benefit from China s entry into the World Trade Organization  which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers  workers  and companies  China is our fourth largest trading partner  with over  100 billion in annual two way trade  The power of market principles and the WTO s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens  There are  however  other areas in which we have profound disagreements  Our commitment to the self defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one  Human rights is another  We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments  We will work to narrow differences where they exist  but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree   The events of September 11  2001  fundamentally changed the context for relations between the United States and other main centers of global power  and opened vast  new opportunities  With our long standing allies in Europe and Asia  and with leaders in Russia  India  and China  we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive   Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge  We can build fruitful habits of consultation  quiet argument  sober analysis  and common action  In the long term  these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress   IX  Transform America s National Security Institutions to Meet the Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty First Century    Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity  They did not touch its source  America is successful because of the hard work  creativity  and enterprise of our people        President Bush Washington  D C   Joint Session of Congress  September 20  2001    The major institutions of American national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements  All of them must be transformed   It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength  We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge  Our military s highest priority is to defend the United States  To do so effectively  our military must     assure our allies and friends     dissuade future military competition     deter threats against U S  interests  allies  and friends  and    decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails    The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces  and their forward presence  have maintained the peace in some of the world s most strategically vital regions  However  the threats and enemies we must confront have changed  and so must our forces  A military structured to deter massive Cold War era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur  We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges   The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the U S  commitments to allies and friends  Through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others  the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom  To contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face  the United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia  as well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment of U S  forces   Before the war in Afghanistan  that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies  Yet  in a very short time  we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation  using every branch of the armed forces  We must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing  long range precision strike capabilities  and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces  This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland  conduct information operations  ensure U S  access to distant theaters  and protect critical U S  infrastructure and assets in outer space   Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare  strengthening joint operations  exploiting U S  intelligence advantages  and taking full advantage of science and technology  We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is run  especially in financial management and recruitment and retention  Finally  while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism  the goal must be to provide the President with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the United States  our allies  and our friends   We know from history that deterrence can fail  and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred  The United States must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy    whether a state or non state actor    to impose its will on the United States  our allies  or our friends  We will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations  and to defend freedom  Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing  or equaling  the power of the United States   Intelligence    and how we use it    is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states  Designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive  fixed object    the Soviet bloc    the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets   We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats  Intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends  We need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us  Those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury   We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security  Since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the United States  we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement   Initiatives in this area will include     strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence to lead the development and actions of the Nation s foreign intelligence capabilities     establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies     continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage     investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities  and    collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all source analysis    As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend America s interests  it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations  We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy  The State Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments  And in this new era  its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations and international institutions  Officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world  including public health  education  law enforcement  the judiciary  and public diplomacy   Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations  civil wars  and other humanitarian catastrophes  As humanitarian relief requirements are better understood  we must also be able to help build police forces  court systems  and legal codes  local and provincial government institutions  and electoral systems  Effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals  backed by American readiness to play our part   Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others  we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand America  The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations  It does  however  reveal the clash inside a civilization  a battle for the future of the Muslim world  This is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where America must excel   We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations  inquiry  or prosecution by the International Criminal Court  ICC   whose jurisdiction does not extend to Americans and which we do not accept  We will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation  through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect U S  nationals from the ICC  We will implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act  whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U S  personnel and officials   We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security  The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this war  At home  our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the American people   Today  the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing  In a globalized world  events beyond America s borders have a greater impact inside them  Our society must be open to people  ideas  and goods from across the globe  The characteristics we most cherish    our freedom  our cities  our systems of movement  and modern life    are vulnerable to terrorism  This vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks  As time passes  individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies  fleets  and squadrons  This is a new condition of life  We will adjust to it and thrive    in spite of it   In exercising our leadership  we will respect the values  judgment  and interests of our friends and partners  Still  we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require  When we disagree on particulars  we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives  We will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together  with our allies and our friends  our shared fundamental interests and values   Ultimately  the foundation of American strength is at home  It is in the skills of our people  the dynamism of our economy  and the resilience of our institutions  A diverse  modern society has inherent  ambitious  entrepreneurial energy  Our strength comes from what we do with that energy  That is where our national security begins   \n",

      " This article from NYTimes com has been sent to you by khare alumni caltech edu    Texas Pacific  in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below  actually does invest in promising new companies  not just turnarounds  It s just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their  7 2B portfolio    so far   Rohit  khare alumni caltech edu   Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend  August 25  2002 By RIVA D  ATLAS and EDWARD WONG       It was one of the first calls David N  Siegel placed when he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways last March  Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner and meaner business plan  keep his planes flying and renegotiate costly contracts with the unions  he flipped through his files and found the number for the Texas Pacific Group  an investment firm headed by David Bonderman  a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation for fixing problem companies   Mr  Siegel  once a top executive at Continental Airlines  had watched Texas Pacific s partners turn an investment of  66 million in the airline  made three years after it filed for bankruptcy in 1990  into a profit of more than  600 million  And they had made nearly as much on their stake in America West  which filed for bankruptcy in 1992   That search for advice turned into an offer  Why not let Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways  revival  asked Richard Schifter  the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr  Siegel reached   In June  Mr  Siegel called Mr  Schifter again  And days before US Airways announced its plans to file for bankruptcy two weeks ago   but after it had negotiated about  550 million in concessions with its unions   Texas Pacific  based in Fort Worth and San Francisco  agreed to kick in  100 million as part of a  500 million loan to keep the company operating during bankruptcy  It also agreed to buy  200 million of stock  or 38 percent of the company  and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges from bankruptcy   unless another investor surfaces with a better offer    One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks were   said James Coulter  a partner at Texas Pacific  in an interview after the bankruptcy filing   There aren t many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to delve into the airline industry    Texas Pacific  which manages  8 billion  thrives by buying businesses no one else wants  Mr  Coulter and Mr  Bonderman made their names during the recession of the early 1990 s with investments in Continental and America West  The firm s hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping companies  sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its extensive network of contacts for talented replacements   Now the partners are again looking for trouble  In the last year alone  Texas Pacific has announced or completed six acquisitions  most in unloved industries like semiconductors  reinsurance and airlines  Just last month  it announced plans to buy Burger King  which has been losing market share  for  2 26 billion  It is also bidding for Bankgesellschaft Berlin  a large and troubled bank   The most creative  and potentially lucrative  of these deals could be Texas Pacific s acquisition last November of MEMC Electronic Materials  a semiconductor company  for  6   yes  just  6   in cash  It will also guarantee a  150 million bank loan   In the last few years  most firms that specialize in leveraged buyouts   the use of junk bonds  bank loans and other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies   have been largely inactive  Falling stock prices have made managements reluctant to sell cheaply  Companies that are for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze   Texas Pacific is different   This is a terrific environment for them   said Stephen Schwarzman  chief executive of the Blackstone Group  which also specializes in buyouts   Mark Attanasio  a managing director at Trust Company of the West  which has invested with Texas Pacific  said   Most other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing  You don t see many guys wanting to take on operational fixes    Like most other buyout firms  Texas Pacific tries to keep its inner workings private  its partners rarely grant interviews and its Web site is perpetually under construction  Mr  Bonderman  Mr  Coulter and William Price  the third founding partner  declined to be interviewed for this article   Mr  Bonderman  59  is known for his rumpled shirts and bright  patterned socks   He likes argyle socks  and they tend to fall down around his ankles   said Henry Miller  an investment banker who advises troubled companies  Early in his career  when he was a Washington lawyer  Mr  Bonderman argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit   When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated  he is known for obsessively staying in touch  even when he is trekking in places like Pakistan  Nepal and  most recently  Bhutan   Whenever I see a long  unfamiliar phone number pop up on my caller I D   I know it s David calling   said one investment banker who often works with Mr  Bonderman   Mr  Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980 s as the chief investment officer for Robert Bass  the Texas oilman  Mr  Bonderman enriched Mr  Bass a second time by making early bets in industries like cable television and taking stakes in troubled companies like American Savings   Loan  which had been seized by the government  Over nearly a decade  Mr  Bonderman s picks earned an average annual return of 63 percent for Mr  Bass   In 1993  Mr  Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr  Coulter  a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also worked for Mr  Bass  They teamed up later that year with Mr  Price  a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain   Company  a consulting firm  to form Texas Pacific   The three men have complementary skills  investment bankers and other deal makers said  Mr  Bonderman is the master strategist and Mr  Coulter is good at structuring deals and the detailed management of the firm s purchases  Mr  Price often recruits managers and advises on operational issues    David is very much the optimist  very much the deal maker   said Greg Brenneman  a former president of Continental   Jim is very much a counterbalance to David  He will sit back and ask the tough questions  He will approach investments a little bit more skeptically than David does    By the end of the 1990 s  Texas Pacific was well established in deal making  It easily raised  4 5 billion from pension funds and other investors in early 2000  To celebrate their war chest  the firm s partners rented San Francisco s City Hall and hired the B 52 s to play at a party   But as the stock market began to tumble  Texas Pacific hesitated  For a 17 month stretch  the partners made no deals  They checked out some of the biggest corporate blowups  including Adelphia  Xerox and Global Crossing  but stayed away  finding the prices and the quality of the businesses untenable   Instead  Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing investments  taking more than  2 billion in profits during that stretch    They started to cash out early in the cycle   said Mario Giannini  chief executive of Hamilton Lane  a money management firm  some of whose clients are Texas Pacific investors   The good times of the late 1990 s were not ideal for Texas Pacific   it struggled to find downtrodden companies that needed its help   But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the rough  It revived Oxford Health Plans  the health maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the mid 1990 s  almost doubling its money after bringing in new managers and upgrading computer systems  In 1996  it made a  280 million investment in Ducati Motor  the Italian motorcycle maker  whose profits have since more than quadrupled   But Texas Pacific also stumbled  usually when it bought at the top of the market  Texas Pacific s  560 million investment in the J  Crew Group  the clothing retailer  for which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997  has been a disappointment  So has its 1999 purchase of Bally  the shoe maker  which has suffered from lower demand for luxury goods   Texas Pacific also lost more than  100 million on Zilog  a semiconductor company  and Favorite Brands  a candy maker  both of which filed for bankruptcy   Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm s performance  Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in two investment funds it raised over the last decade  The first fund  a  720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and including investments made through March 1997  should return more than 40 percent  according to one Texas Pacific investor  But its second fund    2 5 billion raised in 1997   could return less than half that  this investor estimated  since the firm had less time to take profits on these investments before the stock market sank   But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings in the second fund  profits on these investments could rebound  It is hoping  for example  that with new management in place  J  Crew will turn around as the economy rebounds  In any case  one competitor said   their returns look pretty good when you consider that some other funds won t return any capital  to investors   But with the weak economy throwing many companies into trouble  Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier success  the investor said   They should do exceptionally well   he said   Texas Pacific has a distinct style   if not formula  It relies on talented  self sufficient managers to restructure troubled companies  preferring to remain hands off  except for surveillance from the boardroom  When necessary  it replaces managers   Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy  for example  Mr  Bonderman watched with frustration as his old friend Robert R  Ferguson  the chief executive  led it to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court   Continental s board  where Mr  Bonderman was chairman  then brought in Gordon M  Bethune  an executive at Boeing  and in October 1994 he replaced Mr  Ferguson as chief executive  Mr  Bethune quickly did a top to bottom overhaul of the company and is now considered a great turnaround artist of the industry    The biggest conflict I ve ever seen was with Bob Ferguson   said Clark Onstad  a former general counsel for the Federal Aviation Administration  in describing the thinking of Mr  Bonderman  whom he has known since the 1982 Braniff bankruptcy   He chose Bethune over his longtime friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a better job    At America West  Texas Pacific initiated an even more extensive management overhaul  This time  the charge was led by Mr  Coulter and Mr  Schifter  both directors   W  Douglas Parker  the current chief executive  flew to Mr  Coulter s home in San Francisco to interview for the job of chief financial officer  They talked for hours  and Mr  Parker said the two men quickly realized they had  somewhat kindred spirits    The board replaced most senior managers at America West  except William Franke  the chief executive  who stepped down last September  His restructuring plan had made the airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from bankruptcy in August 1994   Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West  worth about  33 7 million  But those are controlling shares  and the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes    These are not passive investors  nor am I   said Donald L  Sturm  a Denver businessman who serves on Continental s board with Mr  Bonderman and Mr  Price   You re active  Your money is at stake  Your reputation is at stake    After overseeing managers who worked successfully with unions at Continental and America West  Texas Pacific has a good reputation with labor  That was one reason US Airways was interested in a Texas Pacific investment  said Chris Chiames  a spokesman for the airline   Mr  Siegel wanted an investor who would  be as labor friendly as possible   Mr  Chiames said  But US Airways can still entertain other bids this fall  and Marvin Davis  the billionaire investor from Los Angeles  has expressed interest   Texas Pacific s investment in Burger King  made with Goldman  Sachs and Bain Capital  was announced after two years of discussions among Texas Pacific s partners and the chain s franchisees   even before the company  which had been owned by Diageo  the liquor company  was put up for sale  said Julian Josephson  chairman of the National Franchisee Association  which represents most Burger King franchisees    We liked what they had to say about the human component of the businesses they buy   Mr  Josephson said  Many other owners  he added   are dismissive of labor    At Burger King  Texas Pacific will also be working with an executive it knows  Burger King s chief executive is John Dasburg  the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines  who met Mr  Bonderman and his partners when Northwest bought out their stake in Continental in 1998   Unlike most buyout firms  Texas Pacific remains enamored with the technology industry  despite the failure of so many start ups the last two years  It has focused on the semiconductor industry  which like the airline industry is highly cyclical  So far  though  results have been mixed   The firm s 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation  which makes equipment for high speed Internet connections  has been a huge success  Texas Pacific split it in two and took both parts public in the late 1990 s  selling most of its stakes for 23 times its investment  But a much larger investment  its  400 million acquisition of Zilog  the chip maker  in 1998  was made just before the economic crisis in Asia caused chip prices to plummet  Zilog filed for bankruptcy last year   Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third company  ON Semiconductor  which it acquired for  1 6 billion three years ago  It invested  100 million more last year   Its latest gamble on the industry  the  6 deal for MEMC  may prove the most lucrative  The cost of mailing the payment to E On  based in D sseldorf  Germany  was actually more than the acquisition  one executive close to the deal said   Texas Pacific  and its partners in the deal  Trust Company of the West and Leonard Green   Partners  agreed to guarantee a  150 million revolving line of credit  Texas Pacific also assumed  900 million worth of debt  most of which it swapped for more stock in the company    They did a good job of timing the acquisition   said Nabeel Gareeb  the company s chief executive  who noted that in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit since the fourth quarter of 2000   But Texas Pacific s interest in airlines is clearly sizable  Besides its involvement in Continental  America West and US Airways  the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet  the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group   Two years ago  Texas Pacific started a Web based discount ticket service called Hotwire  It put up most of the  75 million in seed money  then persuaded six airlines to invest with it  said Karl Peterson  the chief executive  Hotwire  instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets  as Priceline does  shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until after the sale   The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt Hotwire  which is privately owned  Mr  Peterson said that the company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific remains committed to it   Last spring  Mr  Peterson met Mr  Bonderman in Aspen to talk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding  Mr  Bonderman seemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the steep Internet chute  But he does have his limits on risk  Mr  Peterson discovered  Before going down the mountain  Mr  Bonderman strapped on a helmet       HOW TO ADVERTISE                                   For information on advertising in e mail newsletters or other creative advertising

      " The Times   December 04  2002  University boom creates era of sexual tolerance  By Helen Rumbelow    THE boom in university education has led to a sea change in Britain s tolerance of homosexuality  according to a report  Just under half the people now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong  down from three quarters 15 years ago  according to the British Social Attitudes survey  regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion   That trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities  with 75 per cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced  compared with 60 per cent in 1987   Geoffrey Evans  a politics professor at Oxford University  decided to focus on what has caused Britain to become more open minded in a report published today  The study  from the National Centre for Social Research  is based on interviews with a cross section of 3 500 people   Young people are much more tolerant than their elders  with a quarter of twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong  compared with two thirds of pensioners   But the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college  with graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no GCSEs  and a third less racist   That transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from and  with 41 per cent of young people now attending university  it was a powerful social effect  Professor Evans said    Mr Blair s famous mantra  education  education  education  seems far less consequential now than when first announced in 1997  as Britain struggles with an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people get degrees  degrees buy less and less   he said    But the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance   he added   He decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just  political correctness  by testing how many civil rights the educated would give to an unattractive minority  white supremacists   Again  people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and university  with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections  three times as many as those with no qualifications   It is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant  the report says  adding that it may be simply because university students have increased contact with alternative points of view   Professor Evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their idealism  but found the opposite to be true   Thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties  He said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older generation  Britain would become an ever more relaxed place   Soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability  with more than half the country wanting cannabis to be legalised  compared with a third seven years ago  That is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread  with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it   A third of Labour voters  twice as many as Conservatives  had tried the drug  and being young  living in London and having a degree also increased the chances   One issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs  Most take a strong position on heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years  Now the proportion of people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept up to 97 per cent    The views on heroin show that Britain is by no means becoming a liberal free for all   Alison Park  co director of the study  said   People are making quite a clear distinction between what they think  of  as right and wrong    On other matters  the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits   in fact  they account for 6 per cent  that union membership has fallen by a fifth in the past 18 years  with just under a third of workers in a union  and that half those questioned oppose secondary school selection  In 1984 the figure was 40 per cent   The survey also indicates that 19 per cent of men aged between 25 and 34 live with their parents  twice as many as women       To unsubscribe from this group  send an email to  forteana unsubscribe egroups com    Your use of Yahoo  Groups is subject to    \n",

designed   specifically to process XML data  Unlike competing solutions that   process XML data in software  DataPower s device processes   the data in   hardware    a technology achievement that provides greater   performance    according to company officials      The new device  dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator  is the   first in a   family of products expected from the Cambridge  Mass  based   startup  The   DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology   called XG3 that does the analysis  parsing  and processing of the XML   data      According to Steve Kelly  CEO of DataPower  the XA35 Accelerator was   conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML  the anticipated future   proliferation of Web services  and as a means to share data   between two   businesses       Our vision is to build out an XML aware infrastructure   Kelly said     The XA35 is the first of a family       Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the   file size up   to 20 times  This  he said  makes processing the data very taxing on   application servers  DataPower believes an inline device is the best   alternative      In addition to the large file sizes  security is also of paramount   importance in the world of XML       Today s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only   Kelly   said   A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall    Firewalls are blind to XML today       Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on   security  especially as Web services proliferate  Kelly said      According to DataPower  most existing solutions to offload XML   processing are homegrown and done in software    an approach   the company   itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with   regards to speed   and security  After trying the software path  the company turned to   creating a solution that would process XML in hardware       Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code   said Kelly    adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does  Kelly   said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with   technologies that claim to do XML processing    claims that   he believes   will be mostly false    Other content aware switches  such as SSL  secure socket layer    accelerators and load balancers  look at the first 64 bytes   of a packet    while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection  looking at   1 400 bytes   and thus enabling greater processing of XML data  Kelly explained      The 1U high network device has been tested against a large   collection of   XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the   markup language   as they pass through the device      The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load   balancer  and it will inspect all traffic that passes and   will identify   and process those packets that are XML  Kelly said      In addition to proxy mode  the device can also be used as an   application   co processor  This deployment method gives administrators   more granular   control over what data is inspected and the application server itself   controls the device      DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging   market  Startup   Sarvega  based in Burr Ridge  Ill   introduced the Sarvega   XPE switch in   May  and earlier this month Tarari  an Intel spin off    launched with a   focus on content processing and acceleration    The DataPower device is now available  priced starting at    54 995  The   company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in   field trails at a number of other enterprises                                                                                       DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs   since it was   founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov  a technology visionary who   foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols   would have on enterprise networks  Long before industry   interest in XML   grew  Kuznetsov assembled a team of world class M I T  engineers and   designed the industry s first solutions to address the unique   requirements for processing XML  The first such solution was   a software   interpreter called DGXT  This software based approach to XML   processing   is still licensed by many companies for use in their own   products today      Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from   developing software based accelerators  Kuznetsov s team   raised the bar   and designed a system for processing XML in purpose built   hardware  In   2001  DataPower s effort produced XML Generation Three  XG3    the   industry s fastest technology for XML processing  bar none      Today  XG3  technology powers the industry s first wire speed XML   network devices  enabling secure  high speed applications and XML Web   Services  While other companies are just now marketing first   versions of   products  DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology    providing an immediate return on technology investments to   industry leading customers and partners      DataPower s M I T  heritage is complemented by a management team that   brings decades of experience in the networking and computing   industries    drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including   Akamai  Argon  Cascade  Castle Networks  Sycamore and Wellfleet                                                                                       DataPower Technology Secures  9 5 Million in

DataPower s solutions are based on   its patent pending XML Generation Three  XG3   technology       Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter and   intra company communications but their network infrastructure is ill   prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type    DataPower s XML acceleration devices enable the wirespeed   processing of   XML that is required to support next generation enterprise   applications   said Eugene Kuznetsov  CTO and founder of DataPower   Technology       DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that s   critical to Web   services projects without sacrificing an ounce of   performance   A single   DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10   servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML   processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment  In   addition  the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security    protection against XML based denial of service attacks  connection of   e business protocols for incompatible XML data streams  load   balancing   between back end servers and real time statistics reports       In the post bubble economy  technology investment decisions require   laser focused scrutiny  DataPower s patent pending technology   addresses   a very real and growing pain point for enterprises   said Michael   Tyrrell of Venrock Associates   By turbo charging their networks with   DataPower s unique XML Aware networking technology  companies will be   free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering   performance and security pitfalls        We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing   the rapidly   growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and   security   said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital     DataPower is on   their third generation of technology  Their patent pending XML   Generation Three  XG3  technology was quite simply the single most   compelling technology solution we have seen to date        XML is not a nice to have  it is a must have for enterprises serious   about optimizing application efficiency  Since 1999    DataPower has been   developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web   services   said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners   DataPower s   XML acceleration devices are a key

      "   LIMA  Peru  Reuters     Lina Medina s parents thought their 5 year old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru s Andes could find no cure  her father carried her to hospital   Just over a month later  she gave birth to a boy   Aged 5 years  seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939  Medina made medical history  and is still the youngest known mother in the world   At the time  Peru s government promised aid that never materialized  Six decades on  Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor  crime ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as  Little Chicago    Now 68  she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past  Gerardo  the son she delivered while still a child herself  died in 1979 at the age of 40   But a new book  written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case  has drawn fresh attention to Medina s story  and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance    The government condemned them to live in poverty  In any other country  they would be the objects of special care   Jose Sandoval  author of  Mother Aged 5   told Reuters    We still have time to repair the damage done to her  That s my fundamental objective   he added    Totally willing to help  Sandoval has raised Medina s case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp  and has asked the government to grant her a life pension    something officials say is possible    We re totally willing to help her   said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda  But Suni Ramos  of the social action department of Karp s office  said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning    such as kitchen and other household equipment    it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed  It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family   Medina s husband  Raul Jurado  told Reuters his wife remained skeptical   She got no help  in 1939  that I know about   he said   She thinks governments never deliver  Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true    Jurado said his wife  whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  had turned down Reuters  request for an interview   Medical rarity No one has ever established who was the father of Medina s child  or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped   One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo  an Andean village at an altitude of 7 400 feet  2 250 meters  in Peru s poorest province  Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history  Sandoval said   He said she had her first period at 2 1 2  became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby  they found she already had fully mature sexual organs   Her swelling stomach worried her parents   They thought it was a tumor   he said  But shamans ruled out village superstitions    including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them    and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town  Pisco   There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant   Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest    he was later released for lack of evidence    and doctors  police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case   Sandoval  who based his book on media and other published information  and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment  said news of the child mother to be drew instant offers of aid  including one worth  5 000 from a U S  businessman  which was turned down   More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital  where her fully developed 6 pound  2 7 kg  baby was born on May 14  1939    Mother s Day   One offer was worth  1 000 a week  plus expenses  for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World s Fair in New York  Another  from a U S  business that the family accepted in early June 1939  was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case  The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort   But within days  the state trumped all previous offers  decreeing that Medina and her baby were in  moral danger   and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them   But Sandoval said   It abandoned the case after six months    It did absolutely nothing for them    Happy ending  Though physically mature  Medina    who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms    still behaved like a child  preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby  who was fed by a wet nurse   Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months  finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again   After taunting from schoolmates  Gerardo    who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor    discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother   He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body s bone marrow  but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young   Medina married and in 1972 had a second son  33 years after her first  Her second child now lives in Mexico   She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject   We just want to get on with our lives  that s it   said Jurado  adding he thought  absolutely nothing  of the fact his wife was the world s youngest mother   He said the couple s main concern now  if the government s offer of aid was genuine  was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then government expropriated more than two decades ago  That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site   He said its value was  more or less  25 000  and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own    they live now in a modest house  accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board  in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves  paradise    If the government really wants to help   they should give us the value of our property   he said   As for Sandoval  he said he was optimistic that Medina s story  which he has studied since his student days  would turn out well   I believe there will be a happy ending   he said    As a result of the war  corporations have now been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed   Abraham Lincoln  Nov 21  1864 in a letter to Col  William F Elkins

It took two hours to find her    The first day I went out with Wan  she came back to my hotel and hung all my clothes up and tidied the room  I thought it was marvelous   he said   I knew then there was something special    Moylan  49  is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet    and marry    Thai women  He lives in England now with 28 year old Wan  who is expecting their first child   Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women in developing countries  offering dreams of a new life in the West that often turn sour  But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand in search of a wife    I got to Thailand at 2 p m   and by 4 p m  I d met Wan   he said   I knew I found her attractive  I could tell straight away that she was very caring    Moylan spent a week in Thailand  and after returning to England kept in touch with Wan by phone and mail  Six months later she came to England and the couple married   MR  MARRIAGE  Lawrence Lynch  49  runs Thai Professional Introduction Services  the agency Moylan used to meet his wife  Lynch  who calls himself  Mr  Marriage   started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction agency   Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages    In the last five years we ve done about 400   he said   To the best of my knowledge  they have all been successful    Male clients pay  2 213 for the service  although men from countries that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount  Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women looking for a husband  If they like what they see they come to Bangkok   Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch s office    encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems    We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies   Lynch said   But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax    After the first meeting  couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better  Within two weeks of arrival  Lynch says  almost every client has found a potential wife    At the end of a fortnight it s very  very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasn t made his mind up   he said  In most cases  marriage follows  usually within the next year   Roongthip Kamchat  managing director of Thai No  1 Connections  a Bangkok based agency  says she has introduced about 1 000 couples  and less than 10 percent have broken up   Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife    Sometimes they are very nervous   she said   And sometimes they are very impatient and say  Give me a lady  I want to get married now   I say   Calm down  OK  we ll talk     But if men are really in a hurry  Roongthip says  she can find them a wife and get them married within a week  Lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man  a man with one leg and a man with post traumatic stress disorder   WHY   Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries  Critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country  and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West   But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy  there is no reason to object   If you talk about people who are needy  I think everybody wants someone to love them  and wants someone to love  so yes  I need Wan   he said    Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand  I think there s no secret there  They are looking for a better life  I don t have a problem with that  In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband    Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too  and that is why they choose to use his agency   His brochure promises an alternative to the  kind of de feminized  over sized  self centered  mercenary minded lady available on the British singles scene   and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are not  God s gift to women    Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their own countries    and found Thai women attractive    They don t know how to meet women  Even if they go to pubs or discotheques or restaurants or department stores  how can they ask people to marry them  Impossible   she said    Many Thai girls are slim  have long hair  black eyes  small nose  They are good at taking care and joking and laughing  not strict  Different from ladies from other countries    Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap  the agencies say this is not a problem  They say language problems are also not a major obstacle    Thai ladies are not ageist  and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older   Lynch said   When I met my wife she couldn t speak a word of English  We muddled along with a phonetic dictionary  The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up very quickly    Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the West    We have kitchens  we have study classes   Roongthip said   We teach them how to eat  and when to make tea    PITFALLS  But not all dreams come true   Bee  is a 26 year old Thai woman who went to Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency  Now she is back in Bangkok  sad and angry    He had no friends  and I was so lonely   she said   I tried to make him happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean  He never spoke to me    Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year   I thought I would be happy there   she said   But it was the worst time of my life    Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run  he makes checks to ensure unsuitable candidates are weeded out    We are ethical and professional   he said   We will not take on all comers    Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls  his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work  Wan s sister has just signed up with Lynch s company  looking for a foreign husband    Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited  I m sure there are   Moylan said   But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal

      " This article from NYTimes com has been sent to you by khare alumni caltech edu    Texas Pacific  in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below  actually does invest in promising new companies  not just turnarounds  It s just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their  7 2B portfolio    so far   Rohit  khare alumni caltech edu   Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend  August 25  2002 By RIVA D  ATLAS and EDWARD WONG       It was one of the first calls David N  Siegel placed when he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways last March  Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner and meaner business plan  keep his planes flying and renegotiate costly contracts with the unions  he flipped through his files and found the number for the Texas Pacific Group  an investment firm headed by David Bonderman  a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation for fixing problem companies   Mr  Siegel  once a top executive at Continental Airlines  had watched Texas Pacific s partners turn an investment of  66 million in the airline  made three years after it filed for bankruptcy in 1990  into a profit of more than  600 million  And they had made nearly as much on their stake in America West  which filed for bankruptcy in 1992   That search for advice turned into an offer  Why not let Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways  revival  asked Richard Schifter  the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr  Siegel reached   In June  Mr  Siegel called Mr  Schifter again  And days before US Airways announced its plans to file for bankruptcy two weeks ago   but after it had negotiated about  550 million in concessions with its unions   Texas Pacific  based in Fort Worth and San Francisco  agreed to kick in  100 million as part of a  500 million loan to keep the company operating during bankruptcy  It also agreed to buy  200 million of stock  or 38 percent of the company  and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges from bankruptcy   unless another investor surfaces with a better offer    One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks were   said James Coulter  a partner at Texas Pacific  in an interview after the bankruptcy filing   There aren t many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to delve into the airline industry    Texas Pacific  which manages  8 billion  thrives by buying businesses no one else wants  Mr  Coulter and Mr  Bonderman made their names during the recession of the early 1990 s with investments in Continental and America West  The firm s hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping companies  sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its extensive network of contacts for talented replacements   Now the partners are again looking for trouble  In the last year alone  Texas Pacific has announced or completed six acquisitions  most in unloved industries like semiconductors  reinsurance and airlines  Just last month  it announced plans to buy Burger King  which has been losing market share  for  2 26 billion  It is also bidding for Bankgesellschaft Berlin  a large and troubled bank   The most creative  and potentially lucrative  of these deals could be Texas Pacific s acquisition last November of MEMC Electronic Materials  a semiconductor company  for  6   yes  just  6   in cash  It will also guarantee a  150 million bank loan   In the last few years  most firms that specialize in leveraged buyouts   the use of junk bonds  bank loans and other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies   have been largely inactive  Falling stock prices have made managements reluctant to sell cheaply  Companies that are for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze   Texas Pacific is different   This is a terrific environment for them   said Stephen Schwarzman  chief executive of the Blackstone Group  which also specializes in buyouts   Mark Attanasio  a managing director at Trust Company of the West  which has invested with Texas Pacific  said   Most other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing  You don t see many guys wanting to take on operational fixes    Like most other buyout firms  Texas Pacific tries to keep its inner workings private  its partners rarely grant interviews and its Web site is perpetually under construction  Mr  Bonderman  Mr  Coulter and William Price  the third founding partner  declined to be interviewed for this article   Mr  Bonderman  59  is known for his rumpled shirts and bright  patterned socks   He likes argyle socks  and they tend to fall down around his ankles   said Henry Miller  an investment banker who advises troubled companies  Early in his career  when he was a Washington lawyer  Mr  Bonderman argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit   When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated  he is known for obsessively staying in touch  even when he is trekking in places like Pakistan  Nepal and  most recently  Bhutan   Whenever I see a long  unfamiliar phone number pop up on my caller I D   I know it s David calling   said one investment banker who often works with Mr  Bonderman   Mr  Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980 s as the chief investment officer for Robert Bass  the Texas oilman  Mr  Bonderman enriched Mr  Bass a second time by making early bets in industries like cable television and taking stakes in troubled companies like American Savings   Loan  which had been seized by the government  Over nearly a decade  Mr  Bonderman s picks earned an average annual return of 63 percent for Mr  Bass   In 1993  Mr  Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr  Coulter  a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also worked for Mr  Bass  They teamed up later that year with Mr  Price  a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain   Company  a consulting firm  to form Texas Pacific   The three men have complementary skills  investment bankers and other deal makers said  Mr  Bonderman is the master strategist and Mr  Coulter is good at structuring deals and the detailed management of the firm s purchases  Mr  Price often recruits managers and advises on operational issues    David is very much the optimist  very much the deal maker   said Greg Brenneman  a former president of Continental   Jim is very much a counterbalance to David  He will sit back and ask the tough questions  He will approach investments a little bit more skeptically than David does    By the end of the 1990 s  Texas Pacific was well established in deal making  It easily raised  4 5 billion from pension funds and other investors in early 2000  To celebrate their war chest  the firm s partners rented San Francisco s City Hall and hired the B 52 s to play at a party   But as the stock market began to tumble  Texas Pacific hesitated  For a 17 month stretch  the partners made no deals  They checked out some of the biggest corporate blowups  including Adelphia  Xerox and Global Crossing  but stayed away  finding the prices and the quality of the businesses untenable   Instead  Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing investments  taking more than  2 billion in profits during that stretch    They started to cash out early in the cycle   said Mario Giannini  chief executive of Hamilton Lane  a money management firm  some of whose clients are Texas Pacific investors   The good times of the late 1990 s were not ideal for Texas Pacific   it struggled to find downtrodden companies that needed its help   But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the rough  It revived Oxford Health Plans  the health maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the mid 1990 s  almost doubling its money after bringing in new managers and upgrading computer systems  In 1996  it made a  280 million investment in Ducati Motor  the Italian motorcycle maker  whose profits have since more than quadrupled   But Texas Pacific also stumbled  usually when it bought at the top of the market  Texas Pacific s  560 million investment in the J  Crew Group  the clothing retailer  for which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997  has been a disappointment  So has its 1999 purchase of Bally  the shoe maker  which has suffered from lower demand for luxury goods   Texas Pacific also lost more than  100 million on Zilog  a semiconductor company  and Favorite Brands  a candy maker  both of which filed for bankruptcy   Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm s performance  Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in two investment funds it raised over the last decade  The first fund  a  720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and including investments made through March 1997  should return more than 40 percent  according to one Texas Pacific investor  But its second fund    2 5 billion raised in 1997   could return less than half that  this investor estimated  since the firm had less time to take profits on these investments before the stock market sank   But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings in the second fund  profits on these investments could rebound  It is hoping  for example  that with new management in place  J  Crew will turn around as the economy rebounds  In any case  one competitor said   their returns look pretty good when you consider that some other funds won t return any capital  to investors   But with the weak economy throwing many companies into trouble  Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier success  the investor said   They should do exceptionally well   he said   Texas Pacific has a distinct style   if not formula  It relies on talented  self sufficient managers to restructure troubled companies  preferring to remain hands off  except for surveillance from the boardroom  When necessary  it replaces managers   Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy  for example  Mr  Bonderman watched with frustration as his old friend Robert R  Ferguson  the chief executive  led it to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court   Continental s board  where Mr  Bonderman was chairman  then brought in Gordon M  Bethune  an executive at Boeing  and in October 1994 he replaced Mr  Ferguson as chief executive  Mr  Bethune quickly did a top to bottom overhaul of the company and is now considered a great turnaround artist of the industry    The biggest conflict I ve ever seen was with Bob Ferguson   said Clark Onstad  a former general counsel for the Federal Aviation Administration  in describing the thinking of Mr  Bonderman  whom he has known since the 1982 Braniff bankruptcy   He chose Bethune over his longtime friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a better job    At America West  Texas Pacific initiated an even more extensive management overhaul  This time  the charge was led by Mr  Coulter and Mr  Schifter  both directors   W  Douglas Parker  the current chief executive  flew to Mr  Coulter s home in San Francisco to interview for the job of chief financial officer  They talked for hours  and Mr  Parker said the two men quickly realized they had  somewhat kindred spirits    The board replaced most senior managers at America West  except William Franke  the chief executive  who stepped down last September  His restructuring plan had made the airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from bankruptcy in August 1994   Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West  worth about  33 7 million  But those are controlling shares  and the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes    These are not passive investors  nor am I   said Donald L  Sturm  a Denver businessman who serves on Continental s board with Mr  Bonderman and Mr  Price   You re active  Your money is at stake  Your reputation is at stake    After overseeing managers who worked successfully with unions at Continental and America West  Texas Pacific has a good reputation with labor  That was one reason US Airways was interested in a Texas Pacific investment  said Chris Chiames  a spokesman for the airline   Mr  Siegel wanted an investor who would  be as labor friendly as possible   Mr  Chiames said  But US Airways can still entertain other bids this fall  and Marvin Davis  the billionaire investor from Los Angeles  has expressed interest   Texas Pacific s investment in Burger King  made with Goldman  Sachs and Bain Capital  was announced after two years of discussions among Texas Pacific s partners and the chain s franchisees   even before the company  which had been owned by Diageo  the liquor company  was put up for sale  said Julian Josephson  chairman of the National Franchisee Association  which represents most Burger King franchisees    We liked what they had to say about the human component of the businesses they buy   Mr  Josephson said  Many other owners  he added   are dismissive of labor    At Burger King  Texas Pacific will also be working with an executive it knows  Burger King s chief executive is John Dasburg  the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines  who met Mr  Bonderman and his partners when Northwest bought out their stake in Continental in 1998   Unlike most buyout firms  Texas Pacific remains enamored with the technology industry  despite the failure of so many start ups the last two years  It has focused on the semiconductor industry  which like the airline industry is highly cyclical  So far  though  results have been mixed   The firm s 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation  which makes equipment for high speed Internet connections  has been a huge success  Texas Pacific split it in two and took both parts public in the late 1990 s  selling most of its stakes for 23 times its investment  But a much larger investment  its  400 million acquisition of Zilog  the chip maker  in 1998  was made just before the economic crisis in Asia caused chip prices to plummet  Zilog filed for bankruptcy last year   Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third company  ON Semiconductor  which it acquired for  1 6 billion three years ago  It invested  100 million more last year   Its latest gamble on the industry  the  6 deal for MEMC  may prove the most lucrative  The cost of mailing the payment to E On  based in D sseldorf  Germany  was actually more than the acquisition  one executive close to the deal said   Texas Pacific  and its partners in the deal  Trust Company of the West and Leonard Green   Partners  agreed to guarantee a  150 million revolving line of credit  Texas Pacific also assumed  900 million worth of debt  most of which it swapped for more stock in the company    They did a good job of timing the acquisition   said Nabeel Gareeb  the company s chief executive  who noted that in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit since the fourth quarter of 2000   But Texas Pacific s interest in airlines is clearly sizable  Besides its involvement in Continental  America West and US Airways  the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet  the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group   Two years ago  Texas Pacific started a Web based discount ticket service called Hotwire  It put up most of the  75 million in seed money  then persuaded six airlines to invest with it  said Karl Peterson  the chief executive  Hotwire  instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets  as Priceline does  shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until after the sale   The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt Hotwire  which is privately owned  Mr  Peterson said that the company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific remains committed to it   Last spring  Mr  Peterson met Mr  Bonderman in Aspen to talk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding  Mr  Bonderman seemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the steep Internet chute  But he does have his limits on risk  Mr  Peterson discovered  Before going down the mountain  Mr  Bonderman strapped on a helmet       HOW TO ADVERTISE                                   For information on advertising in e mail newsletters or other creative advertising

      " I ve seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums for several years   I ve always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason   Here is a recent article from U S  News that I actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository    James Rogers jamesr best com                                                  Defrosting the past  Ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers  a bounty of a warming world  BY ALEX MARKELS  As he hiked near Colorado s Continental Divide in the summer of 2001  Ed Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13 000 feet   It looked like a bison skull   the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls   I thought   That s strange  Bison don t live this high up      Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science  where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bison one that died about 340 years ago   This was an extraordinary discovery   says Russ Graham  the museum s chief curator  adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago   There s probably a lot more like it yet to be found    And not just bison  Colorado isn t the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting  Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru to Alaska a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industry have shrunk or thawed many of the world s 70 000 glaciers  As the ice recedes  a treasure trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging  extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze  The fabrics  wood  bone  and DNA rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists  understanding of our predecessors  health  habits  and technology  and the prey they pursued    It s mind boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains   says Johan Reinhard  a high altitude archaeologist and explorer in residence at the National Geographic Society  Rare  spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5 300 year old  Ice Man   found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991  have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information  Now  as the ice continues to retreat  it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains   Vanishing act  The trick is finding such specimens before Mother Nature and looters take them first  Once uncovered  frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals  Moreover  they re often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don t even realize they re ancient   That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in British Columbia  Canada  three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal   It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice   recalls Warren Ward  a teacher from nearby Nelson   But when I looked closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones    Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter  or perhaps a fur trapper  the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip Loc bag and delivered them to local officials  Archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter s body  along with a woven hat  fur clothing  and what seemed to be a medicine bag  Carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago  Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts inchi  or Long Ago Person Found  by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations  who may be his direct descendants   he is perhaps the best preserved human from the period ever found in North America   Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could explain what that long ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place   Before this there was no archaeological record of people living here   says Greg Hare  a Yukon government archaeologist   Now we see that this area was very much part of people s seasonal activities    Like Ward s discovery  the search began by chance  when Kristin Benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband  Gerry Kuzyk  hunted sheep at 6 000 feet in the mountains of the south Yukon  They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung   It was really odd  because I knew there hadn t been caribou in the area for at least 100 years   recalls Kuzyk  then a wildlife biologist with the Yukon government   Caribou cake  Returning a week later  he found  what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it   It turned out to be a 4 300 year old atlatl  or spear thrower  Further investigation of the ice patch and scores of others around the region revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7 800 years of changing hunting practices   Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies  Hunters followed the game  They returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice   We ve got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1 200 years ago   says Hare  who now oversees the research project   Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1 300 years ago  And by 1 200 years ago  there s no more throwing darts    Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck  They are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska s Wrangell and St  Elias mountain ranges the United States  most glaciated terrain and in the Andes  Johan Reinhard thinks the fast  thawing European Alps could also deliver more findings  perhaps as exquisite as the Ice Man   Global warming is providing us high altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now  We re probably about the only ones happy about it      \n",

Sent  Monday  September 23  2002 2 44 PM Subject  How about subsidizing SSL access to Google      In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week   The Search Goes On   Sept  19th   the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of Google s service is not its card catalog  which merely points surfers in the right direction  but the entire library  By maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web  if you can get to Google s cache  you can read anything you d like   The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce these rules  however  all depend on the fact that traffic to and from Google  or indeed almost all public websites  is unencrypted  Almost all Web browsers  however  include support for Secure Sockets Layer  SSL  encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like  Upgrading to SSL makes it effectively impossible for a  man in the middle  to meddle  censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in China  The only choice left is to either ban the entire site  range of IP addresses   but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article   Of course  the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money  If the United States is so concerned about the free flow of information  why shouldn t the Broadcasting Board of Governors sponsor an encrypted interface to Google  or for that matter  the rest of the Web   To date  public diplomacy efforts have focused on public sector programming for the Voice of America  Radio Sawa  and the like  Just imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private sector media instead  Nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself    and most of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project   On second thought  I can hardly imagine this Administration  promoting  the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights  Never mind     Best  Rohit Khare                                                               The search goes on China backtracks on banning Google up to a point  Sep 19th 2002   BEIJING From The Economist print edition  IN CHINESE  the nickname for Google  an American Internet search engine  is gougou  meaning  doggy   For the country s fast growing population of Internet users  46m  according to an official estimate   it is proving an elusive creature  Earlier this month  the Chinese authorities blocked access to Google from Internet service providers in China apparently because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to forbidden sites  Now  after an outcry from those users  access has been restored   An unusual climbdown by China s zealous Internet censors  Hardly  More sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government  Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by Google as it trawls the Internet  These once provided a handy way for Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites   After the blocking of Google on August 31st  many Chinese Internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move  Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site to far less powerful search engines in China   Duncan Clark  the head of a Beijing based technology consultancy firm  BDA  China  Ltd  says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the Internet  Until recently  it had focused on blocking individual sites  including all pages stored on them  Now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content  For example earlier this week when using Eastnet  a Beijing based Internet provider  a search on Google for Falun Gong a quasi Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China  usually aborted before all the results had time to appear  Such a search also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes    \n",

Defrosting the past  Ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers  a bounty of a warming world  BY ALEX MARKELS  As he hiked near Colorado s Continental Divide in the summer of 2001  Ed Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13 000 feet   It looked like a bison skull   the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls   I thought   That s strange  Bison don t live this high up      Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science  where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bison one that died about 340 years ago   This was an extraordinary discovery   says Russ Graham  the museum s chief curator  adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago   There s probably a lot more like it yet to be found    And not just bison  Colorado isn t the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting  Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru to Alaska a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industry have shrunk or thawed many of the world s 70 000 glaciers  As the ice recedes  a treasure trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging  extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze  The fabrics  wood  bone  and DNA rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists  understanding of our predecessors  health  habits  and technology  and the prey they pursued    It s mind boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains   says Johan Reinhard  a high altitude archaeologist and explorer in residence at the National Geographic Society  Rare  spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5 300 year old  Ice Man   found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991  have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information  Now  as the ice continues to retreat  it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains   Vanishing act  The trick is finding such specimens before Mother Nature and looters take them first  Once uncovered  frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals  Moreover  they re often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don t even realize they re ancient   That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in British Columbia  Canada  three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal   It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice   recalls Warren Ward  a teacher from nearby Nelson   But when I looked closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones    Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter  or perhaps a fur trapper  the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip Loc bag and delivered them to local officials  Archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter s body  along with a woven hat  fur clothing  and what seemed to be a medicine bag  Carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago  Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts inchi  or Long Ago Person Found  by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations  who may be his direct descendants   he is perhaps the best preserved human from the period ever found in North America   Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could explain what that long ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place   Before this there was no archaeological record of people living here   says Greg Hare  a Yukon government archaeologist   Now we see that this area was very much part of people s seasonal activities    Like Ward s discovery  the search began by chance  when Kristin Benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband  Gerry Kuzyk  hunted sheep at 6 000 feet in the mountains of the south Yukon  They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung   It was really odd  because I knew there hadn t been caribou in the area for at least 100 years   recalls Kuzyk  then a wildlife biologist with the Yukon government   Caribou cake  Returning a week later  he found  what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it   It turned out to be a 4 300 year old atlatl  or spear thrower  Further investigation of the ice patch and scores of others around the region revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7 800 years of changing hunting practices   Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies  Hunters followed the game  They returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice   We ve got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1 200 years ago   says Hare  who now oversees the research project   Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1 300 years ago  And by 1 200 years ago  there s no more throwing darts    Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck  They are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska s Wrangell and St  Elias mountain ranges the United States  most glaciated terrain and in the Andes  Johan Reinhard thinks the fast  thawing European Alps could also deliver more findings  perhaps as exquisite as the Ice Man   Global warming is providing us high altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now  We re probably about the only ones happy about it    \n",
